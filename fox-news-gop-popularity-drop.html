In polling conducted Nov. 9-16, the network’s average favorability rating among GOP respondents has dropped 13 percentage points, to 54 percent, and the average share of those with an unfavorable view of the network nearly doubled, to 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Even before Nov. 3, the president had been increasingly critical of the network, particularly its news operation, over the years, culminating in an Election Day interview on “Fox & Friends” in which he accused the network of abandoning him.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Somebody said, ‘What’s the biggest difference between this and four years ago?’ And I say ‘Fox, it’s much different,’” Trump told the hosts.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trump supporters have taken their cue from the president. When they marched through the streets of Washington to protest the election, at several points during their demonstration they <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>chanted</a>, “Fox News sucks!”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The network did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Conservatives’ souring on the network has been reflected in other research: Conservative viewership of Fox News on YouTube <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>dropped</a> the week following the election, according to an independent research project called Transparency Tube.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trump reportedly wants to capitalize on this erosion of support for Fox. Last week, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Axios reported</a> that Trump has told friends he wants to create a digital media company to “wreck” the network, according to one source.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5u8uXnNnq6sZZekvW68zqmspZminsG6ecOrpqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sibel-review-1202917280.html><span>←</span><span>Film Review: Sibel</span></a>
