When there are innovations of system, you must plan to regulate it in such a way that it is not injurious to the economy development of Nigeria,” he said.</p><p>Adedeji commended the National Assembly for the support it extended to the revenue service over the years to enable it to meet its target and distribute wealth, adding that innovations by both chambers had helped the Federal Government.</p><p>According to him, the FIRS is on the pact of actualising the target of N19.4 trillion given to it by the National Assembly at the beginning of the year.</p><p>He said that the essence of the engagement was to strengthen the relationship with the legislature and inform them of the impact and effectiveness of the various legislation passed on the agency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyntdGsZKCdpKh6r63SrGSsraClvLPAjK2mZqqVnMKtrdOeZJyqqaXBsHnRnpynmZOpeq%2Bx1marmrBdoa64v45xnW6koG6x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grand-emprunt-comment-seront-utilises-les-500-millions-deuros-pour-la-renovation-energetique-des.html><span>←</span><span>comment seront utiliss les 500 millions d'euros pour la rnovation nergtique des logements</span></a>
