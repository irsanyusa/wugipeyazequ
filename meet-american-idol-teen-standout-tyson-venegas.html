True enough, music has been a part of his life since he was three.</p><p>“I started singing when I was about three years old. My mom would always tell me different lullabies, so I would start repeating them back but in like a jazzy way,” he said. “I started practicing all of my instruments, my piano and my guitar, and I started singing for my lolos and lolas and my titas and titos, and at parties and weddings.”</p><p>At the age of seven, he sealed first place as the youngest winner of the Canadian talent competition PNE Star Showdown. Furthermore, he joined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> Teens Philippines in 2020, making all coaches press their buttons before he could finish the first line of “Change Is Gonna Come” by Sam Cooke.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-impressively-made-it-to-the-top-12-of-american-idol>He Impressively Made It to The Top 12 of American Idol</h2><p>Although a part of Generation Z, Tyson draws influence from classic singers. Some of these musicians are Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. After Tyson’s American Idol audition, his mom revealed that judge Lionel Richie also became an inspiration, his concert being the first music festival Tyson has ever attended.</p><p>“We flip the switch now. I inspired him back then? He just inspired us today,” Richie said.</p><p>Following his powerful rendition of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elton John</a>’s “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” Tyson advanced to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 12 of American Idol</a>. It’s not much of a shock though, as he received earned a standing ovation from the judges after his performance.</p><p>“Thank you everyone for voting for me! Thank you @americanidol for this moment,” he wrote on Instagram.</p><p>To know more about Tyson’s journey in the singing competition series, be sure to tune in every Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern on ABC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/EroQ9ckpuXY</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GabbyWindey_Vinny-220x165.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Alum Gabby Windey Says She, Vinny Guadagnino Still “Talk All The Time”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRorKztcKapWahlKS5bsDEnqVmq6SWu6W71K1krbGjpLtuwsSnnKCZo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agression-des-elus-la-nouvelle-circulaire-aux-parquets-publiee.html><span>←</span><span>la nouvelle circulaire aux parquets</span></a>
