Here's how it all works</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Developer Niantic has finally given Pokémon Go players the ability to battle their fellow Pokémon trainers — a feature that's been in hot demand since the game first launched in the summer of 2016.</p><p>Starting late Wednesday evening, the update started going out to Pokémon Go players. As is usually Niantic's way, it started going out to high-level players first, but it's spreading fast. So if you don't see the option right away, just give it a little bit and try again to see if it's reached you.</p><p>It's already clear that the addition of player-versus-player (PvP) battles is slated to completely change the game. And I mean that literally: Among many other things, the trainer battle update adds the ability for your Pokémon to learn a third attack, beyond the two that they already know. The game's battle system itself is getting tweaked slightly, such that you're rewarded for tapping rhythmically to charge up certain attacks in combat.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Much of it builds on the game's new social features, which were introduced a few months ago alongside the <a href=# id=4dc97260-06c0-53e7-8656-30386317c8fb>also-much-requested Pokémon trading feature</a>. While you can battle strangers, there are a few advantages to fighting your friends.</p><p><strong>Here's how Pokémon Go trainer battles will work:</strong></p><p>The first thing you gotta know is that Pokémon Go battling is sorted into leagues. When you challenge another trainer, you decide ahead of time which league's rules you'll fight under.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6c869f50-40d2-546a-ab0c-70813f8133be data-caption="The first thing you gotta know is that Pokémon Go battling is sorted into leagues.
