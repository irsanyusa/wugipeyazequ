He started struggling with bad <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>habits</a> when he was in high school. This caused problems in his life, like with his relationships and work. He even got into legal trouble because of it.</p><p>When he faced health problems, he realized how serious it was. This made him see that he could have a good life without bad habits.</p><p>Krause's journey to recovery was greatly helped by the support and shared experiences he found in twelve-step meetings. He's very thankful for the people he met there, whose own stories and paths to sobriety played a big part in his own recovery.</p><p>As fans reminisce about the enchanting world of the Halliwell sisters, they also wonder how time has treated the beloved <a href=#>cast</a>.
