His later murders also involved necrophilia, cannibalism, and the permanent preservation of body parts, typically all or part of the skeleton.</p><p>Born in Wisconsin, Dahmer's troubled behavior became evident during childhood. He committed his first murder in 1978, just three weeks after his high school graduation. After a brief enrollment at Ohio State University and a stint in the U.S. Army, Dahmer returned to Ohio, where his criminal behavior escalated.</p><p>Dahmer's murders were particularly gruesome. His pattern included luring victims to his home, drugging them, and then killing them. Post-mortem, he engaged in sexual acts with the corpses and often kept body parts or photographed the bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Dahmer's acts became increasingly macabre, involving acts such as acid experimentation and drilling holes into victims' heads in an attempt to create submissive, zombie-like slaves.</p><p>Despite a few close calls with law enforcement and his increasingly erratic behavior, Dahmer evaded arrest for years. He was eventually captured in 1991 when one of his intended victims escaped and alerted police. After his arrest, Dahmer confessed to all of his crimes, showing investigators <a href=#>polaroid</a> pictures he had taken of his victims and providing detailed descriptions of his murders.</p><p>In 1992, Dahmer was convicted of 15 of the 16 murders he committed in Wisconsin and was sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms in prison. His case attracted significant media attention and public scrutiny, sparking intense debate. Dahmer was killed by a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, in 1994.</p><p>His life and crimes, however, endure in the American mind and have been the subject of numerous books and other representations. He has been played by <a href=#>Jeremy Renner</a> in Dahmer (2002), Ross Lynch in My Friend Dahmer (2017), and <a href=#>Evan Peters</a> in the Netflix series The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022).</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>May 21</a>, <a href=#>1960</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> West Allis, Wisconsin, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Baby Boomer</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Rat</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Gemini</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>November 28</a>, <a href=#>1994</a> (aged 34)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Clubbed to death with a metal bar by fellow inmate Christopher Scarver</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1991-07-22</a> Jeffrey Dahmer confesses to killing 17 men in 1978</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1992-01-13</a> American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer pleads guilty but insane</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1992-02-15</a> Jeffrey Dahmer found sane and guilty of killing 15 boys</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1994-11-28</a> Convicted serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is clubbed to death by fellow inmate Christopher Scarver in the Columbia Correctional Institution gymnasium in Portage, Wisconsin</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Serial Killers</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwtsSfnaudqWKxorTMnqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-carly-simon-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Carly Simon Make?
