Noem took Cricket on a pheasant hunt with older dogs to try to teach the canine, but Cricket went “out of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She said she called Cricket, then used an electronic collar to try to control the dog. On the way home, Cricket escaped Noem’s truck and killed the chickens of a local family, who Noem compensated. The dog then “whipped around to bite me,” the politician wrote.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After that, Noem said, “I realized I had to put her down.” She led Cricket to a gravel pit and shot and killed the dog.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Noem also killed a male goat that she said was “nasty and mean,” smelled “disgusting, musky, rancid,” and “loved to chase” her children, knocking them down and ruining their clothes. She also killed the goat in the gravel pit, although it reportedly took two shots.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Noem said she told the story about Cricket to show that in politics and life, she was willing to do what was “difficult, messy, and ugly” if it was necessary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The backlash from Democrats and conservatives alike has been swift. Rick Wilson, who co-founded the anti-Trump PAC The Lincoln Project, criticized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on X, formerly Twitter,</a> that Noem “killed a puppy because she was lazy at training bird dogs, not because it was a bad dog.” The Lincoln Project released an ad that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said when tough moments come with pets</a>, “shooting your dog in the face is not an option.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Noem responded to the backlash on Friday<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> in a post on X</a>: “We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that’ll have the media gasping, preorder No Going Back,” she concluded, with a link to her book.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With interest in Noem at an all-time high, here’s what you need to know about the U.S. politician.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Who is Kristi Noem?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Noem is the 33rd—and first female—governor of South Dakota, whose motto is “Under God, the People Rule.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 52-year-old was born in Watertown, S.D.
