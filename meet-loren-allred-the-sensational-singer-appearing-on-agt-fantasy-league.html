Her exceptional talent was evident from an early age, leading her to pursue a career in musical theater. After a year of studying musical theater at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, she transferred to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>While in Boston, Loren uploaded videos of her singing to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, catching the attention of renowned singer and producer Ne-Yo. Impressed by her talent, Ne-Yo championed her cause, ultimately leading to a record deal with Island Def Jam. This marked the beginning of Loren’s professional music career, opening doors to opportunities that would showcase her extraordinary vocal abilities.</p><p>Loren wowed the judges and audience with her incredible talent on Season 15 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a> in 2022. Her stunning rendition of “Never Enough” during her audition earned her high praise from the judges and a Golden Buzzer from Amanda Holden, propelling her straight to the semifinals.</p><p>Loren continued to impress with a soulful performance of “You Say” by Lauren Daigle, securing her spot in the final. She showcased her versatility in the grand final with her original song, “Last Thing I’ll Ever Need,” leaving a lasting impression on the BGT stage despite finishing in ninth place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-also-was-on-the-voice>She Also was on The Voice</h2><p>Loren first appeared on The Voice in 2012, during the show’s third season.

Advancing to the Live Playoffs, Loren performed Lisa Stansfield’s “All Around the World,” yet despite her captivating performance, she fell short of securing enough votes to progress, leading to her elimination from the competition.</p><p>In 2017, Loren’s voice was featured on the soundtrack to the film The Greatest Showman. She sang the vocals for the song “Never Enough,” performed by Rebecca Ferguson’s character, Jenny Lind, in the film. “Never Enough” was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 88 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
