The song takes an equality-first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stance</a>, criticizing haters and homophobes alike, and ends with a call to followers to support her Senate petition in favor of the Equality Act, tied in with this month’s celebrations of <a href=#>Pride Month</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are the many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift easter eggs</a> — both within the Swift universe and to pop and celebrity culture more broadly — that the video, co-directed by Drew Kirsch and Swift herself, contains.</p><p></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A Cher quote</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-rich-man.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the beginning of the video, Swift is at home in a trailer decorated lavishly in bubblegum style. There’s a quick cut to a poster with powerful meaning, though: it’s actually a framed Cher quote, from <a href=# rel=noopener>a 1996 interview</a> with the star who rejected certain societal norms and viewed men as a luxury like “dessert.” In the interview, Cher reflects on her mother’s desire for her to settle down and marry a “rich man.” Cher’s reponse? “I said, ‘Mom, I am a rich man.'”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">That Breakfast at Tiffany’s face mask</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-sleep-mask.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the classic scenes in Audrey Hepburn’s seminal 1961 movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Breakfast at Tiffany’s</a> features the actress in a Tiffany-blue silk sleep mask, embroidered with golden closed eyes. Swift’s sleep mask in her music video is lavender silk, and is embroidered with the script “Calm down,” in a possible reference to Hepburn’s style.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A watch with a cat face</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-cat-watch.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pretty much everyone knows Swift is a cat lover. She even recently picked up a new kitten, who made his debut to fans in her <a href=#>music video for “ME!”</a> So Swift’s nod to her feline fixation in this video is revealed on her watch, where the face has an illustration of a cat.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A Lover phone case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-lover-phone.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last week, <a href=#>Swift announced</a> that the title of her upcoming album — it’s due out Aug. 23 — is Lover. She snuck in a nod to the title in the “You Need to Calm Down” video by having it emblazoned on the back of a glittery phone case (which promptly catches fire, soon after she tosses it down).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A giant butterfly back tattoo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-butterfly-tattoo.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just before she shrugs on a hot pink fur jacket, we get a quick peek of Swift’s back, which is almost completely covered in a giant tattoo. The ink depicts a snake in the middle of her back, which expands up into a cloud of butterflies that reach to her shoulders. The tattoo is an ink version of a similar visual from her “ME!” music video, showing her metamorphosis from the <a href=#>Reputation-era snake theme</a> into the Lover era, filled with rainbows and butterflies.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A pool float shot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-pool.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift also spends some time in the video lounging in a pool float in the middle of a perfectly circular and fairly luxe kiddie pool. The scene has strains the arty pool photos that have become popular in the past few years, thanks to drone photography. But the pool float also brings to mind Swift’s <a href=#>own history</a> with floaties: in past years, she was known for hosting lavish summer parties with extravagant floats and slides and a raft of celebrity attendees.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Cameos from Laverne Cox, Hannah Hart and more activists</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-laverne-cox.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The next segment of the “You Need to Calm Down” video features stars like <a href=#>Laverne Cox</a>, known for her activism for transgender rights, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Hannah Hart</a>, a YouTube comedian known for her series “My Drunk Kitchen,” who are each hanging out in their respective front lawns and get moments to shine.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Hayley Kiyoko’s fierce archery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-hayley-kiyoko-1.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Swift sings, “But you’re coming at my friends like a missile,” that’s the cue for <a href=#>Hayley Kiyoko</a> to appear, wielding a bow and arrow — a missile of a more medieval variety. <a href=#>Kiyoko</a> is herself a pop star with hits like “Curious” and “Girls Like Girls,” known as an LGBTQ+ rights advocate and beloved by fans for improving lesbian representation in pop. In the video, Kiyoko hits a bull’s eye with her arrow in the center of a target stamped with the number 5, a hint that some are taking to mean she might feature on the fifth track of Lover.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">An “Archer” reference</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-archer.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On July 23, Swift released the next song in the album — <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Archer.”</a> While Kiyoko did not end up featuring on the song, it is the fifth track on the Lover album, as fans have noticed based on its appearance on the iTunes preorder list. And it turns out this bulls’ eye from “You Need to Calm Down” was an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Easter Egg</a> for the song all along. “The Archer” is a shift from the tone of her lead two singles, a downtempo, introspective pop ballad. “I never grew up, it’s getting so old, help me hold on to you,” she sings in the new song. “I’ve been the archer, I’ve been the prey. Who could ever leave me darling? Who could stay?”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A protest march</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-protest.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Throughout the song, Swift admonishes those who tear others down. “Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?” she asks, referencing the LGBT representation advocacy group. Anti-LGBTQ+ protesters appear sporadically throughout video, carrying signs like “Homosexuality is sin” and easily distinguishable from Swift’s friends with their less-than-colorful attire. This spring, Swift has taken a stand as an LGBTQ+ ally, sharing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">petition on change.org</a> for political support for the Equality Act and writing a letter to her senator.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A Ciara-officiated wedding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-gay-marriage.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</a> (of Modern Family fame) and his husband Justin Mikita get a chance to re-enact their wedding kiss in the video — officiated by Ciara. (Swift further showed up for Ferguson over the past weekend, <a href=# rel=noopener>joining him</a> at the Stonewall Inn in New York City to play a song live.)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A sip of tea with Tan France</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-tan-france.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Tan France</a> is the fashion guru on the Queer Eye reality show, and in “You Need to Calm Down,” he gets his solo moment with a pot of tea — which he gracefully pours down his throat. Not only is France a British citizen, making his tea cameo particularly apt, but as we know, “tea” in pop culture slang is also a reference to hot gossip, about which France appears fully unbothered. Swift then extends the tea metaphor, sitting down to a literal tea party with the rest of the <a href=#>Queer Eye</a> gang — including Antoni Porowski, Karamo Brown, Bobby Berk and Jonathan Van Ness — as she sings “You just need to take several seats.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Adam Rippon serving ice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-adam-rippon.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Olympic figure skating star <a href=#>Adam Rippon</a> is also spotted serving — what else? — the ice-based treat of Sno-Cones, most likely in a wink to his prowess on the ice.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A tattoo for Ellen DeGeneres</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-ellen-degeneres.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Show host and star Ellen DeGeneres is next spotted inside one of the trailers, getting a tattoo on her arm from Adam Lambert that reads “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruel Summer</a>.” This one is a bit of a mystery; “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruel Summer</a>” could be referring to the <a href=# rel=noopener>1983 pop single</a> by the British girl group Bananarama, but that’s a pretty oblique callback. Fans speculate it could be the title of another Lover song.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A spelling error</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-morons.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Swift and her squad recline on lounge chairs with reflective screens to maximize their sun time (and minimize the “shade,” metaphorical and literal), a group of anti-LGBTQ+ protesters encroaches on their space, holding up signs. One reads “Get a brain morans (sic)!” In her last song “ME!” Swift made it a point to call out the importance of spelling. “Hey kids, spelling is fun!” she insists in those lyrics.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A Billy Porter moment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-billy-porter.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tony-winning actor, <a href=#>Pose</a> star and <a href=#>red carpet icon</a> Billy Porter makes his cameo sashaying down the line of sunbathers in a caftan, just as Swift sings, “Can you just not step on his gown?”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The drag “pop queen pageant”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-drag-race.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A lineup of former <a href=#>Drag Race</a> contestants and a famous Beyoncé impersonator participate in a “pop queen pageant,” each dressed up as a different star. Spotted: Tatianna as Ariana Grande, Trinity The Tuck as Lady Gaga, Delta Work as Adele, Trinity K. Bonet as Cardi B, Jade Jolie as Swift, Adore Delano as Katy Perry, A’keria C. Davenport as Nicki Minaj and Riley Knoxx as Beyoncé.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">RuPaul with a prize crown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-rupaul.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But instead of giving the pageant crown to just one of the contestants, RuPaul appears onstage and then tosses it up in the air. It seems like all the pop queens are meant to share the crown,<a href=# rel=noopener> á la Mean Girls</a>, perhaps.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ryan Reynolds at work on a painting</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-ryan-reynolds.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Deadpool actor <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> has long been in Swift’s universe; he’s married to Blake Lively, one of her squad members of years past, and has popped up at those summer bashes she used to throw. Here, he makes a cameo as a painter, focusing intently on painting a canvas based on a photograph of the historic <a href=#>Stonewall Inn</a>, the site of the 1969 police raid that is considered to have kicked off the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Katy Perry as a hamburger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-katy-perry.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the 2019 Met Gala, <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> dressed up for the after-party in a full-on hamburger costume. She reprises that look for appearance in Swift’s “You Need to Calm Down” video. Swift, herself in a French fries costume, seeks Perry out in the midst of a joyous food fight. The two were previously known to have been involved in <a href=#>something of a standoff</a>, but recently have declared “peace at last.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Equality Act petition</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/taylor-swift-yntcd-equality-act.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This spring, Swift has been putting forward a Senate petition for the Equality Act via change.org, asking supporters and politicians to support her campaign. She throws in an ending card shout-out to the Equality Act here as well. “Let’s show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally,” it reads.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubmBtgHV9jq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2axn6p6r7HEnWStp12Yrq25jJ2msKZdp7KnsdGepZydo2KyubzLmqCnnZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./signs-of-sexual-inactivity-in-men.html><span>←</span><span>Signs of Sexual Inactivity in Men</span></a>
