While awaiting the arrival of his and his wife Kourtney Kardashian’s newborn, Barker can be seen drumming on a pad to the beat of his baby’s heartbeat. This viral video has sparked a tons of reactions on social media.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-barker-s-playful-drumming-of-newborn-baby-s-heartbeat-sparks-backlash-from-fans>Travis Barker’s Playful Drumming of Newborn Baby’s Heartbeat Sparks Backlash From Fans</h2><p>In the video, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barker</a> showed his skills with the drums in a setting usually associated with nervous anticipation and quiet support. The scene happened as Barker awaited the arrival of his and wife Kardashian’s first child together, a baby boy named Rocky 13 Barker. The musician paid tribute to guitarist Rocky George, the iconic boxing film Rocky, and Barker’s favorite number.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kardashian</a> later shared the video on her Instagram Stories, adding to the couple’s tradition of sharing glimpses into their lives with their fans. The pair, described as being “over the moon” about their blended family, already includes Kardashian’s three children—Penelope, Mason, and Reign—and Barker’s three kids—Alabama, Landon, and Atiana.</p><a title=@blind.items href=# rel=noopener>@blind.items</a> <a title=stitch href=# rel=noopener>#stitch</a> with @Travis Barker Travis Barker deciding to whip out he’s drum kit while kourtney was in labour is SENDING MEE 😂 <a title=kourtneykardashianfans href=# rel=noopener>#kourtneykardashianfans</a> <a title=kardashianfans href=# rel=noopener>#kardashianfans</a> <a title=popcultureobsessed href=# rel=noopener>#popcultureobsessed</a> <a title=kourtneykardashian href=# rel=noopener>#kourtneykardashian</a> <a title=kravis href=# rel=noopener>#kravis</a> <a title=travisbarker href=# rel=noopener>#travisbarker</a> <a title=kravisbaby href=# rel=noopener>#kravisbaby</a> <a title=popculture href=# rel=noopener>#popculture</a> <a title=popculturenews href=# rel=noopener>#popculturenews</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Blind Items" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Blind Items</a><p>While social media critics expressed their discomfort with Barker’s delivery room drumming, it seems the couple is unfazed by the online chatter. Known for their openness on social platforms, the pair continues to embrace their unique parenting journey, which has included sharing their pregnancy experiences and the challenges they faced.</p><p>Despite the social media roast, there’s a case to be made for Barker’s choice of activity in the delivery room. Labor can be a lengthy process, and everyone copes differently. Some might choose to pace nervously, while others, like Barker, opt for a more rhythmic approach to pass the time. Parenthood, after all, is a marathon, not a sprint.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-barker-got-more-backlash-with-daughter-alabama-s-revealing-tiktok>Travis Barker Got More Backlash With Daughter Alabama’s Revealing TikTok</h2><p>Travis Barker is once again at the center of controversy, this time involving his 17-year-old daughter, Alabama Barker. Alabama recently posted a TikTok video of herself doing a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sultry dance</a> in a revealing dress, sparking criticism from some fans who questioned Travis’s parenting choices.</p><p>Many expressed concern over the video, with comments ranging from questioning the whereabouts of her parents to accusations of parental failure. Critics slammed Travis, with some tying the controversy to his association with the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p><p>Despite the backlash, some defended Alabama, praising her for embracing her natural beauty and curves. The ongoing debate reflects the challenges of navigating social media scrutiny as a public figure’s child.</p><p>This controversy comes shortly after Travis faced criticism for sharing a video of himself drumming in the delivery room while his wife likely gave birth. Just a day before Alabama’s TikTok post, Travis posted a video practicing on a drum pad to the beat of his unborn son’s heart. While Kourtney seemed supportive, fans had mixed reactions, with some labeling it “the biggest ick of all time.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_MattRife_Taylor-HillGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="TikTok Star Matt Rife Premieres Netflix Comedy Special “Natural Selection”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWRp7Juv8eam6Kml2LBs63VoqpmmpGnuKa%2BjJ%2Bmq2WUp8Kuucinnmagmah6r7HWm6arpl2XrqPF0mafnpmiqa%2BmrdNmoKdlpJ2ybrDEpaCvnaKuerO7zqZm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./25-des-entreprises-pretes-sinvestir-dans-lelaboration-des-plu-et-plh.html><span>←</span><span>25% des entreprises prtes s'investir dans l'laboration des PLU et PLH</span></a>
