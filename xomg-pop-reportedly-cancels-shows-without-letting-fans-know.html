Reportedly Cancels Shows on Tour</h2><p>XOMG POP! kicked off their United States tour earlier this month, visiting cities such as Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, and Boston. However, it looks like they won’t be visiting some of the other cities on their schedule, for reasons that have not been revealed.</p><p>A few days ago, the group posted a photo featuring JoJo Siwa and her mom Jessalynn, apparently taken after their show in Boston. The comments are full of fans complaining that shows in their cities were canceled without notice.</p><p>“Daughter and I pulled up to find out it’s cancelled,” wrote one user who didn’t specify which city. “Praying everything is ok. Just wondering how did everyone else find out? I don’t see it on social media and I don’t think I got an email.”</p><p>Another fan responded that the Philadelphia show (scheduled for June 16) was canceled 12 hours ahead of showtime. Someone else wrote that they were notified that the show in Silver Spring, Maryland (scheduled for June 17) was canceled the day before. Other fans have confirmed that shows in Atlanta, Orlando, and Dallas are also canceled.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FANS CRITICIZE JOJO SIWA FOR XOMG POP’S TOUR CONDITIONS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-group-is-advertising-the-final-two-shows>The Group Is Advertising the Final Two Shows</h2><p>As of this writing, the group does not appear to have announced the cancellations on their social media, or given an explanation for it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Live Nation</a> currently lists San Diego and Anaheim as the only upcoming performances, on June 28 and 29.</p><p>The group posted links to purchase tickets to these shows on their Instagram stories. However, the pinned posts on their account still show the full tour schedule, including the six shows that were apparently canceled.</p><p>“They are advertising the last two shows as if nothing happened!” wrote one fan on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “Who would feel comfortable attending those with travel costs just to have them cancel last minute. GIRLS! Do the right thing and make a statement!”</p><p>Some commenters said they spent money on travel and concert outfits only to find out that the shows were canceled. Fans seem to be in agreement that the group (or, more specifically, the Siwas) should release a statement explaining the situation.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_BenAffleck_JenniferLopez_Christopher-Polk_Golden-Globes-2024_Golden-Globes-2024-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck Are Reportedly ‘Discussing Divorce’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5716ikoGWgpL1uvsSppquslZm5unnCmqWcnZyoerS0zrCqZq%2BZqbWwwdNmo56spJ67qHnFmqWsZZujvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-university-of-hawaii-rainbow-warriors.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 Worst Team Names</span></a>
