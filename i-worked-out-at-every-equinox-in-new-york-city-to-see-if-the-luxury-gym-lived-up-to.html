They have expertly crafted a brand that truly evokes <a href=# id=4bd9685a-ce29-30ad-a26c-6f3b3943d9f4>luxury</a> , <a href=# id=129af0ef-defc-3cfd-a223-4b3348f1b688>sex</a> , and wellness even when brought up in casual conversation.</p><p>The gyms are notoriously expensive Equinox's top membership costs $500 per month with a $750 initiation fee and it's not uncommon to hear people quip that they can't afford it.</p><p>For a long time, that reputation kept me away, but in February, with my local Williamsburg gym membership feeling a bit ragged, I decided to dip my toe into Equinox's waters.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>What I discovered was a vast network of gyms at various price points with different amenities, aesthetics, and services.</p><p>Paying for a single gym can cost anywhere between $185 and $220 per month, typically with a $300 initiation fee, varying by gymand offers available. An "All Access" membership costs $260 per month plus a $500 initiation fee and gives you a membership at all 29 regular locations in New York Cityand clubs nationally, but doesn't allow access to premium "E" clubs, Sports Clubs, or other special locations. A destination membership allows you access to all clubs except for E clubs and costs $300 per month on top of a $500 initiation fee. And an E membership gives you access to all clubs, costing $500 per month on top of a $750 initiation fee.</p><p>During the enrollment process, the scope of options left me a bit baffled How was I supposed to choose to have access to a set of gyms that I've never been to?</p><p>So, I decided to embark on a nearly two-month journey exploring all of Equinox's offerings in New York City. I worked out at all 34 Equinox locations in the city (not counting Long Island or Westchester).</p><p>Here's an overall guide to Equinox memberships in New York, what every location is like, and my personal rating of every gym out of 10.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8hmrqiqm5qxbrvUrWSarF2aw6a%2B2Gacqq2Zo7y5ecinZKedp2LGsL7KZpqirKliwbB50p6cZqGWYsGpsYylrLGtoq56qMXMZqOirpWZera8jK2maK5nq4V1sNE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courtney-love-fired-fight-club-brad-pitt-kurt-cobain-film-1235475704.html><span>←</span><span>Courtney Love Says She Lost Fight Club Role After Rejecting Brad Pitts Kurt Cobain Mo</span></a>
