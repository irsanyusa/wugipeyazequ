In a surprising twist, former professional dancer and esteemed judge Julianne Hough has stepped into the co-host position, joining forces with Alfonso Ribeiro in the ballroom. Their combined expertise and shared experience of winning the coveted Mirrorball trophy bring a unique perspective to the show.</p><p>The tragic passing of the legendary Len Goodman on April 22, 2023, created an irreplaceable void that will forever remain unfilled. However, his spirit lives on through the unwavering commitment of his fellow judge, Hough. As a seasoned professional and multiple Mirrorball champion, Hough is ready to embrace his expanded role on the panel.</p><p>In a move that delighted many fans, Season 32 will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">air on both</a> ABC and the streaming service Disney+. Last season, the show exclusively aired on Disney+, leaving some viewers feeling disappointed. Now, with the return to ABC, fans from both platforms can unite in supporting their favorite contestants and exercising their voting power.</p><p>Make sure to mark your calendars as DWTS returns in the fall of 2023, airing on Mondays at 8/7c on ABC and streaming on Disney+.
