The judges were impressed by his original song, called “Pretty Baby.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-wows-with-original-song-in-agt-early-release>Singer Wows with Original Song in AGT Early Release</h2><p>Alex Sampson told the judges that he was “a little bit nervous” before his audition for AGT. Simon Cowell broke the tension a bit by complimenting Alex’s black T-shirt, which looked a lot like the one he was wearing.</p><p>The singer shared that he would be singing an original song he wrote called “Pretty Baby.” Although he was clearly anxious, Alex delivered an amazing performance. The song had a retro sound, and Alex showed off an impressive voice.</p><p>The audience cheered when Alex was done singing, and Cowell gave him a standing ovation. Sofia Vergara told Alex that she couldn’t tell that he was nervous when he was performing. Alex said his legs were shaking, but he was “glad that you didn’t notice.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TALENTED FOOT JUGGLER IMPRESSES THE JUDGES IN ‘AGT’ EARLY RELEASE AUDITION</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-judges-think>What Did the Judges Think?</h2><p>Vergara told Alex that she thought he gave “a great audition.” Heidi Klum said she could hear his nerves, but it “made you more real in a way.” Howie Mandel remarked that Alex’s voice reminded him of the lead singer of the 1960s group Herman’s Hermits.</p><p>“I love that, and that’s kind of retro. And nobody’s doing that now,” Mandel said. “So not only, I think, is it good, but I think you’re creating something that doesn’t exist right now.”</p><p>Cowell agreed that the song sounded like something from the 1950s or 1960s, calling it “the kind of song you would hear in, like, a Martin Scorsese movie.” He added that it’s “very smart” for Alex to set himself apart from other artists.</p><p>Alex earned four “yes” votes from the judges to move on. Catch his audition on the new episode of AGT this Tuesday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Original_ReidWilson_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Standout ‘AGT’ Teen Singer Reid Thomas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKloJ2iYrauvNGeqqydo2LBqbGMo6ydn5Woeri106FkqKqZnLavrctmqqiml2K2r3nAoKtmnZGnubp50Z6jnpmjmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roger-daltrey.html><span>←</span><span>Roger Daltrey (Singer) - On This Day</span></a>
