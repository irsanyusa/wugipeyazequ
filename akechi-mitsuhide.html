Mitsuhide had previously been an important general in service of Nobunaga, aiding him in the many campaigns involved in the unification of Japan.</p><p>Mitsuhide started out as a bodyguard in the service of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who Nobunaga would eventually place in power as shōgun. After a successful defence of his shōgun, Nobunaga invited Mitsuhide to join him. This was the beginning of their collaboration towards unification.</p><p>This collaboration ended with the betrayal at Honnō-ji in 1582, where Mitsuhide attacked Nobunaga when he was unprepared and forced him to commit seppuku. This event, known as the Honnō-ji Incident, has given rise to great speculation. Mitsuhide had no clear motives, nor are any recorded.</p><p>While Mitsuhide survived the event, and also soon brought a similar end to Nobunaga's eldest son, Nobutada, who also died by seppuku, this was not to last. Nobunaga's loyal servants, <a href=#>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> and <a href=#>Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, rushed to avenge Nobunaga.</p><p>Mitsuhide was killed while fleeing the Battle of Yamazaki by the bandit leader Nakamura Chōbei. The tale has it that Nakamura was in a village that Mitsuhide passed through, and that he killed him by thrusting his spear out of a bamboo grove.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>March 10</a>, <a href=#>1528</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Tara Castle, Mino Province, Japan<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Pisces</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>July 2</a>, <a href=#>1582</a> (aged 54)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Killed while fleeing the Battle of Yamazaki</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Japanese People</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwrcqemqGhXaK2tb%2FUoaCdnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./finance-common-summit-un-evenement-dedie-au-financement-public-au-service-de-territoires-plus.html><span>←</span><span>un vnement ddi au financement public pour des territoires plus rsilients</span></a>
