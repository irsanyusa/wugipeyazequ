A&nbsp;few days later, he&nbsp;surprised her with a&nbsp;call and invited her to&nbsp;meet him. This unexpected gesture left Nita stunned, as&nbsp;she couldn’t believe that Dhirubhai himself had reached out to&nbsp;her. Upon arriving at&nbsp;the office, Dhirubhai asked if&nbsp;she’d be&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;meeting his eldest son, Mukesh, and that’s how their paths crossed!</p><p>While Nita appreciated Mukesh Ambani’s down-to-earth demeanor, she still had doubts about marriage. However, Mukesh was certain about his feelings for Nita and was ready to&nbsp;commit to&nbsp;their relationship.</p><p>«Nita was really the first girl. I&nbsp;had pretty much made up&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind that this is&nbsp;it, this is&nbsp;my&nbsp;life partner. I&nbsp;could sense in&nbsp;Nita that she was there and not there also,» Mukesh Ambani <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p><h2>Nita had a&nbsp;condition.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/709/695/2a806f5d4ea4ffa2790641245d.jpg><p>After a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;meetings, during a&nbsp;bustling moment in&nbsp;Mumbai, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>billionaire</a> businessman decided to&nbsp;pop the question, urging Nita to&nbsp;give her answer amidst the chaos of&nbsp;traffic snarls. He&nbsp;recounted how, while driving on&nbsp;Peddar Road, he&nbsp;spontaneously asked Nita if&nbsp;she would marry him.</p><p>To&nbsp;this, Nita replied with a&nbsp;<strong>«Yes,» but she had a&nbsp;condition</strong>. She expressed her desire to&nbsp;continue working even after marriage, to&nbsp;which Mukesh agreed wholeheartedly. Their unconventional proposal took place in&nbsp;1985, and they have been married ever since.</p><p><h2>Their love transcended social class differences.</h2></p><p>Growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;middle-class <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, Nita wanted to&nbsp;share her lifestyle with Mukesh while they were dating. She insisted on&nbsp;taking the bus instead of&nbsp;Mukesh’s Mercedes, wanting him to&nbsp;experience her way of&nbsp;life. Together, they embarked on&nbsp;Nita’s favorite double-decker bus route through the city. In&nbsp;return, Mukesh suggested his favorite Mumbai <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>street food</a> joints to&nbsp;Nita, demonstrating that <strong>he&nbsp;is&nbsp;more than just the wealthy heir</strong> who often makes headlines.</p><p>Now, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leads</a> the Dhirubhai Ambani International School, showcasing her passion for <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> and nation-building. She also became actively <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>involved</a> in&nbsp;the Reliance Group. Interestingly, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Mukesh Ambani <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that his childhood dream was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher. He&nbsp;revealed that until his father brought him into Reliance, he&nbsp;had aspirations of&nbsp;studying at&nbsp;a&nbsp;US university and potentially working at&nbsp;the World Bank or&nbsp;teaching as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professor.</p><p><h2>But what, if&nbsp;Nita said «No»?</h2></p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;that moment, Nita playfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> Mukesh what he&nbsp;would have done if&nbsp;she had declined his proposal. In&nbsp;his characteristic manner, Mukesh responded with grace, saying that he&nbsp;would have <strong>respectfully dropped her home and remained friends with her</strong>. Their love story stands as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the idea that genuine love transcends all boundaries. Despite their prominence and wealth, Mukesh and Nita’s relationship is&nbsp;rooted in&nbsp;love, respect, and mutual admiration.</p><p>Mukesh and Nita’s love story continues to&nbsp;inspire couples everywhere. It’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;<a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a>, strength, and sticking by&nbsp;each other through thick and thin. From a&nbsp;spontaneous proposal in&nbsp;traffic to&nbsp;working together to&nbsp;build their empire, their journey is&nbsp;truly extraordinary. It&nbsp;shows that even amidst the hustle and bustle of&nbsp;Mumbai, true love can prevail, proving that fairy tales can come true in&nbsp;real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afc/331/55ef2a5103a5ed19ca14d2250f.jpg><p>Gouhier-Guibbaud-Nebinger-Orban/ABACA/EAST NEWS</p><p>Before leaving, do&nbsp;you remember that <a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a> recently performed at&nbsp;the pre-wedding festivities of&nbsp;the son of&nbsp;India’s richest person?
