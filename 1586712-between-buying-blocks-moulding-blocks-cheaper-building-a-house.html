He is knowledgeable on real estate issues and often educates people on social media on choices to make when building or buying a house.</i></strong></p><h2>Is it better to buy blocks when building a house in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>Buying blocks is a better option if you want to speed up your building project while maintaining secrecy about the construction. Additionally, buying blocks <a href=#>can</a> save you from dealing with various suppliers, such as sand and water vendors, clearing ground for mold preparation, and cement providers, and also minimize the risk of rain damage or theft of materials like cement bags.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d95573d1a6c729f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian airlines risk shutting down as jet fuel increases to N1,500 per litre</span></p></a><h2>What are the benefits of moulding your own blocks?</h2><p class=align-left>Moulding blocks is not only cheaper but also offer the advantage of determining the mixing ratio to ensure strength and durability, unlike pre-bought blocks that may prioritize profit over quality, resulting in weaker structures. Additionally, there are no transportation costs associated with moulding your own blocks.</p><h2>Which one is cheaper, considering the high cost of cement now?</h2><p class=align-left>Molding your own block is significantly better and more cost-effective than purchasing one. However, the only drawback is that it requires a considerable amount of time.</p><h2>What would be your advice to someone building a house in the current cost of cement?</h2><p class=align-left>If they have not yet begun building the foundation of their house, I would advise them to wait until the price of materials decreases. However, if they are currently working on the foundation, I suggest pausing at the dpc level and waiting for prices to drop before proceeding. If they have a deadline and want to plaster the house, I would recommend starting with the outside walls before the rainy season begins. This will help protect the structure from water damage and ensure a successful plastering process.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8e48e094e64e50c0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I withdrew N50,000 from the ATM, I was debited Despite no cash was dispensed, what can I do?</span></p></a><h2>Man shows off N5 million house</h2><p class=align-left>Earlier, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> reported that a construction worker had <a href=#>sparked a debate online</a> after showing off a fine two-bedroom bungalow.</p><p class=align-left>While sharing the photo via Twitter, he asked netizens to give him only N5 million to build it for them.</p><p class=align-left>However, some people have argued that N5 million may not be able to build such a house.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Disclaimer: Advice given in this article is general in nature and is not intended to influence readers' decisions about investing or financial products.
