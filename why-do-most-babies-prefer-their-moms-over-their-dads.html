But it's important to know that it's not a competition between the parents. Both of you are equally loved by your child, it's just that dads need to make an extra effort to let their child be more comfortable around them.</p><p>For dads who want to get closer to their child, they should try to spend more quality time with your child, and make it a point to bond with them everyday. It also helps if they can handle the responsibility of putting their child to sleep, so that not only will their child be comfortable around them, their wife will also have time to rest after a long day of taking care of their newborn.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-f6b05d3b-5849-4a7e-8ffc-8994d76e221e data-caption="Why do most babies prefer their moms over their dads?"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Y2sktkpTURBXy9hYWMwMzE0MDJkNjM5Yjc2YjNmZjdlM2I4ZjZmY2E1ZS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>Letting the child get used to their father taking care of them will help build an emotional connection, and will enable the child to understand that their dad is also someone who they can depend on, and someone who will keep them safe.</p><p>Familiarity is important for kids, especially at such a young age, since the bonds that they build while they're young will last until the rest of their lives. So in order to build a loving relationship with their child, it's always best to start early.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR71qGwZpyfYrqwv9NmmZqamZrAbrzRnp2eql2ptaa10WakqKWjYry3sdFmq6Gdmad6pa3DrGZvnZqhwKu9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./assets.html><span>←</span><span>Visit Wales</span></a>
