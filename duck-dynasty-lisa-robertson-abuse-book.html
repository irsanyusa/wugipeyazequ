They don’t shy away from the dark stuff — marital problems and alcohol abuse, namely — but the biggest and darkest reveal comes in a chapter written by Lisa, Alan’s wife, who <a href=# rel=noopener>joined the show</a> in its fourth season. In it, she describes being sexually abused by a relative when she was a child:</p><figure class=text-left readability=30><p>As a little girl, I had an extended family member who had major drug and alcohol problems. Unfortunately, that person lived with my grandparents, so I had to see him often. Because I spent so much time at my grandparents’ house, I was easy prey for him. My earliest memory of being molested was at the age of seven when he started to do things to me, things that made me feel bad and dirty.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Robertson never told her parents, until much later when she had her own children. The abuse continued until she was a teenager, when she threatened that she would tell her father and he would kill her abuser. She writes that she believes the trauma of her abuse led her to think that her “purpose in life was to please men,” contributing to her straying from her marriage. Eventually, as religion played more of a role in her life, she says she was able to heal herself and her marriage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So why reveal such a personal matter in a chapter in the middle of book that’s also about cooking and Sunday school, in a context where readers probably expect hijinks about hunting?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Robertson explains that she did it because she’s aware that “what happened to me happens to many, many people” and that she wanted to show those people that she was able to recover. Though her own personal method of recovery, through religion, may not work for everyone, she gets her message across:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28.5><p>…I want all abuse survivors to know they have hope. They can have hope for complete healing, hope for great relationships, and hope for a wonderful life, free from the lingering effects of the trauma they have suffered.</p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbWJpgXCw1JyiZpypo660wNhmo6KrkWK%2FsK7Eq6usp55irqPB0p5km6efoHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fela-kuti-afrobeat-legends-lifestyle-influenced-his-children.html><span>←</span><span>Afrobeat legend's lifestyle influenced his children</span></a>
