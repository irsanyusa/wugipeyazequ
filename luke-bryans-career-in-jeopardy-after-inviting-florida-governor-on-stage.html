Heat from fans has prompted the country singer to release an official statement addressing the event.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luke-bryan-brings-ron-desantis-on-stage-during-jacksonville-concert>Luke Bryan Brings Ron DeSantis On Stage During Jacksonville Concert</h2><p>Twitter recently exploded with tweets slamming Luke Bryan about his on stage special guest. The guest of the night was none other than Florida governor Ron DeSantis. The controversial political figure went onto the stage at the start of Bryan’s concert.</p><p>They announced their plans to donate a large portion of the proceeds from Bryan’s upcoming concert to the Florida Disaster Fund. The fund aims to help communities affected by Hurricane Ian which destroyed countless properties and took the lives of at least 89 people in September.</p><p>“The state of Florida had to deal with the major hurricane last month and it’s not easy to deal with, it’s hurt a lot of people.” DeSantis said. “Though I can tell you this, show me any other state that can rebuild bridges in three days. I don’t think you can find that.”</p><p><a href=#>The singer’s</a> upcoming concert in Estero, Florida was rescheduled to November 2 because the Hertz Arena is being used as a hurricane shelter.</p><p>“So, what we’re going to do is give a large portion of the proceeds in Estero, Florida,” Bryan said. “I’m donating that money to the great state of Florida.”</p><p>Fans took to Twitter to share that they do not support the governor. DeSantis is labeled a racist and homophobic individual who signed a policy that LGBTQ advocates call the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bryan Issues a Statement Addressing the Backlash</h2><p>The large collective tweets from fans couldn’t go unnoticed by the singer anymore and he issued his own statement on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. A lifelong fan of Bryan for example, expressed his disappointment of the singer showing his support for DeSantis in a tweet that received over 40,000 likes.</p><p>Fans planned to stop listening to Bryan’s music, and said they’ll no longer watch American Idol as long as he’s a judge. The singer released a statement to explain his side of the story, and what led him to support the governor.</p><p>“Governor DeSantis is a very polarizing figure,” Bryan wrote in the statement. “But I grew up in a country where if a governor ask you if they can come and raise awareness to help victims of a natural disaster you help.”</p><p>Bryan then explained that he’s someone who stayed out of politics throughout his career and only plans to raise awareness for the recent natural disaster. Unfortunately though, his statement did little to appease the angered fans.</p><p>“Sorry but that’s not good enough. You can raise awareness (and money) with your own name. Having DeSantis on stage with you gives the impression that you supported him.” One fan responded to the statement.</p><p>Bryan refuses to elaborate further on the topic and chose to ignore the backlash after his statement. It’s clear that he quickly realized that responding further would add fuel to the fire and will not help his current situation.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_TaylorSwift_Dimitrios-KambourisGetty-Images-for-MTVParamount-Global.jpg alt="Taylor Swift Announces Upcoming ‘Eras’ Tour Dates for 2023" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>luke bryan</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y66inmWSp8aiutJmmpqqlZq%2FbrXNZqGep6CWv6XFjJqdrZ2iYravwsitoKefXZu5sL7InZhmn5%2BrsrO6zqtkqKZdqMGis8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./encore-beaucoup-faire-pour-linnovation-des-pme.html><span>←</span><span>Encore beaucoup faire pour l'innovation des PME</span></a>
