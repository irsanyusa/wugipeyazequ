Rowling has a history of espousing what many have deemed to be transphobic views, leading some fans and observers on social media to call for boycotts of the Potter series and its related products.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though Rowling’s standing among U.S. consumers has fallen in recent years, neither the majority of Harry Potter fans nor Americans in general are likely to boycott any part of the entertainment franchise based on her books, according to a new Morning Consult survey. Despite the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>author’s claims</a> that she had been canceled for her comments, in the United States, at least, the data says otherwise.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m">How the ‘Wizarding World’ franchise stacks up against others</h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">More than 3 in 5 (63%) of millennials and 82% of self-identified Harry Potter fans are still interested in additional content from the franchise’s “Wizarding World.”&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Among adults overall, 46% said they’re eager for more Harry Potter content, but demand for the franchise ranked behind that of the “Jurassic World,” “Pirates of the Caribbean,” James Bond, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and “Star Wars” franchises. Demand for more Harry Potter films was <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>down 3 points from October</a>, when 49% of U.S. adults said they were interested in more from the franchise.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Despite some social media users calling for a boycott of Harry Potter content, consumers largely oppose taking that action. Approximately half of adults, along with roughly 3 in 5 of the franchise’s fans, said they wouldn’t boycott the Harry Potter book series, the “Fantastic Beasts” film series or Harry Potter theme parks.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m">Harry Potter fans remain loyal, but more controversies are stewing</h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The drama surrounding Rowling, who declined to comment via a spokesperson, doesn’t appear to have made a serious dent in the Potter franchise’s fandom, as the data reveals fans are showing few signs of abandoning the franchise that has spawned a theme park, seven books, 11 movies and an upcoming video game and TV show (so far).&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Rowling herself has taken a step back from being the face of the franchise to focus on other endeavors (she does, however, share a screenwriting credit for “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” in theaters tomorrow). The franchise has problems beyond Rowling, including the personal behavior of “Fantastic Beasts” stars Ezra Miller and Johnny Depp. Warner Bros. is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>reportedly re-evaluating its commitment</a> to the spinoff franchise due, in part, to the mounting controversies involving its talent.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The Secrets of Dumbledore” is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>projected to open</a> somewhere in the $40 million to $55 million range this weekend, according to analysts. While that would be a smaller opening than previous entries in the series, there is still an appetite for the franchise, even with Rowling’s involvement. The days of it dominating pop culture, however, are likely over — and backlash against the author certainly hasn’t helped.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>Survey</i></a><i> conducted April 8-10, 2022, among a representative sample of 2,210 U.S. adults, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOo6Jmqp%2Bsuaq6xmafmqqirnqxu9OtnKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fonds-de-soutien-pour-les-emprunts-toxiques-derniers-jours-pour-deposer-une-demande-daide.html><span>←</span><span>derniers jours pour dposer une demande d'aide</span></a>
