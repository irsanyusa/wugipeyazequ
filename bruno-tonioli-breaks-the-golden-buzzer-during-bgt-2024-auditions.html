Fans will have to wait until the new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BGT</a> season airs later this year to see which performance prompted Tonioli to hit the Golden Buzzer so enthusiastically.</p><p>Breaking props is nothing new for the animated judge. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tonioli</a> accidentally hit the Golden Buzzer midway through a contestant’s act during his very first appearance on BGT last season. Addressing the premature buzzer mishap after his BGT debut, Tonioli admitted he got caught up in the moment and forgot the instructions not to press it prematurely.</p><p>“They were like, ‘Here are the rules, you press it then, not then,’ but that went out the window,” Tonioli said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can’t take <a href=#>@BrunoTonioli</a> anywhere, he’s already BROKEN the <a href=#>#GOLDENBUZZER</a> on Day 1 of the 2024 Auditions 😱</p><p>Aaron <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7sDNhjBdEx</a></p>— All Things Britain’s Got Talent (@AllThingsBGT) <a href=#>January 24, 2024</a><p>The former Strictly Come Dancing judge also let some inappropriate language slip out during live finals episodes last season, cursing on air twice. So it’s no surprise that Bruno is already breaking props and causing behind-the-scenes chaos as BGT auditions kick-off. His animated antics and impromptu outbursts have become his signature.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bruno-tonioli-was-initially-anxious-about-joining-bgt>Bruno Tonioli Was Initially Anxious About Joining BGT</h2><p>When he first joined BGT last year, Tonioli admitted he was anxious since he had never actually watched the show before. However, Bruno quickly found his groove on the judges’ panel, keeping audiences entertained with his dramatic reactions and commentary.</p><p>“I was nervous because I had no idea. I had never seen the show.” Tonioli said. “I was actually nervous because it’s like you’re jumping into a play, you’ve never rehearsed with a cast you do your performance with.”</p><p>While Tonioli is clearly settling into his BGT role, some reports suggest his future on the show could be uncertain amid rumblings over his salary.</p><p>Sources claim Tonioli may have negotiated a sizable pay increase that could rankle fellow judges <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon</a>. However, ITV has not commented publicly on any behind-the-scenes pay disputes.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>And there we are, the <a href=#>#BGT</a> gang is back together and Auditions are in full swing!✨ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wTb3O6lg8f</a></p>— BGT (@BGT) <a href=#>January 24, 2024</a><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_ColinStoughRedCarpert_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Everything to Know About ‘American Idol’ Alum Colin Stough’s Girlfriend" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wausp6ddqbyvtc6loGaaopqurL%2BMrZ%2BeZZekuaWxzWaZrrKqmr9usNSroKefXZe0tXmRaWltZZGqsarAyKilrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angelica-hale-drops-new-song-chapter-one-on-american-reject-soundtrack.html><span>←</span><span>Angelica Hale Drops New Song 'Chapter One' on 'American Reject' Soundtrack</span></a>
