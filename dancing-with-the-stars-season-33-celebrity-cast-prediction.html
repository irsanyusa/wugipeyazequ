With a premiere date of September 17, it’s time to start guessing which celebrities will be on the season. Here’s our predictions and who their partner should be (assuming the professional cast is the same as last year).</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-sasha-colby>1 . Sasha Colby</h2><p>We hope to see the return of drag stars on DWTS season 33. There’s no one better to bring drag back than superstar Sasha Colby. We loved Shangela paired with Gleb Savchenko, and would love to see Savchenko paired with Colby on this season!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Are you <a href=#>#TeamSasha</a>? 👑</p><p>Retweet, like, comment, and use the hashtag if you want <a href=#>@sashacolby</a> to snatch the <a href=#>#DragRace</a> crown! 🏁</p><p>Watch tonight’s new <a href=#>#DragRace</a> NOW on <a href=#>@wowpresentsplus</a> (worldwide ex.

David Archuleta</h2><p>American Idol icon David Archuleta was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> to be joining DWTS Season 32, but didn’t. Since we love Archuleta, we’d love to actually see him on DWTS! Archuleta needs a bold professional partner, possibly one that wants to defend their winning title? We’d love to see Archuleta with none other than Val Chmerkovskiy.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was always a Dipsy stan <a href=#>#CantCancelPride</a> <a href=#>@iHeartRadio</a><br>📸: Wes and Alex <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jsVGcNbxR9</a></p>— David Archuleta (@DavidArchie) <a href=#>June 12, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-ilona-maher>3. Ilona Maher</h2><p>It’s no secret that DWTS loves recruiting Olympians, so expect to see more than one on this list. Team USA Rugby member Ilona Maher may get an invite this season, since she’s absolutely dominating social media. We’d love to see Maher paired with one of last season’s finalists, Pasha Pashkov.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Iconic if I do say so myself <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BbnR34CxXY</a></p>— Ilona Maher (@ilona_maher) <a href=#>August 3, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-sutton-stracke>4. Sutton Stracke</h2><p>Earlier this year, Real Housewives star Sutton Stracke was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> as a celebrity joining DWTS season 33. At the time, gossip account Deux Moi shared a tip from an anonymous source claiming that a “very fancy” star of&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;“who wasn’t fond of Magic Mike’s dancing has been signed for&nbsp;DWTS.” We think she’d be paired with Sasha Farber.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#WeekendVibes</a> and have a Happy Caturday! 😽💗 <a href=#>#sustainable</a> jacket is my go to! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/B2R0Zfr1Ba</a></p>— SuttonStracke (@SuttonBStracke) <a href=#>April 27, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-nick-digiovanni>5. Nick DiGiovanni</h2><p>MasterChef alum and social media star Nick DiGiovanni would be perfect for DWTS Season 33. The chef is pretty popular on both TikTok and YouTube. We think DiGiovanni would be paired with DWTS pro KoKo Iwasaki.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-angeria-paris-vanmicheals>6. Angeria Paris VanMicheals</h2><p>It would be super cool to see more than one drag queen on this DWTS season. There’s none better than recent Drag Race All Stars winner Angeria Paris VanMichaels. We think that VanMichaels would be paired with a solid professional partner, like Alan Bersten.</p><p lang=ca dir=ltr>👑 Angeria Paris VanMicheals (<a href=#>@Angeriavm</a>) 🏁 <a href=#>#DragRace</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/k17vxI55DH</a></p>— RuPaul's Drag Race (@RuPaulsDragRace) <a href=#>December 3, 2021</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-liam-payne>7. Liam Payne</h2><p>It’s about time we saw a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a> member on DWTS. Payne has endured a year of hardships, rehab for sobriety and a string of health problems, so DWTS would be the perfect platform for his comeback. We would love to see Payne paired with Jenna Johnson.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don’t forget to get your free Stan Pass and be amongst the first to see an exclusive performance and unseen footage on Sunday as well as some other future surprises!💧<a href=#>https://t.co/RDesCbauWI</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/G2d2Y2spj1</a></p>— Liam (@LiamPayne) <a href=#>March 23, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-regan-smith>8. Regan Smith</h2><p>Another Olympian we’d love to see join the DWTS roster is Swimmer Regan Smith. Smith is an 8x Olympic medal winner. In Paris, she competed in 4 x 100m Medley Relay – Mixed, 4 x 100m Medley Relay – Women, 100m Backstroke – Women, 200m Backstroke – Women and 200m Butterfly – Women. We think she’d be paired with Artem Chigvinstev.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“I am genuinely shocked at how fast she is able to swim.” – <a href=#>@missyfranklin</a></p><p>Regan Smith continues to show her speed in the pool by setting world records and making the podium in Paris 🥈 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A8i31h1obT</a></p>— TOGETHXR (@togethxr) <a href=#>July 31, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-joey-graziadei>9. Joey Graziadei</h2><p>Up next is most recent The Bachelor alum, Joey Graziadei. DWTS typically casts the most recent Bachelor or Bachelorette, so this prediction is a bit of a safe choice on our part. We think Graziadei would be paired with Emma Slater.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@BachelorABC</a> couple Joey Graziadei and Kelsey Anderson share their sweet engagement photoshoot. ❤️📸<a href=#>https://t.co/naRYZ7MxWY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rGt7TRr5wb</a></p>— Good Morning America (@GMA) <a href=#>July 26, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-mr-beast>10. Mr. Beast</h2><p>It’s honestly a shock that we haven’t seen YouTuber Mr. Beast yet on DWTS. This YouTube star, who has 308 Million subscribers, is one of the biggest on the platform. We think he’d be a good pair with Britt Stewart.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We built 100 homes and gave them away for free!

Noah Lyles</h2><p>After Noah Lyles shocking 100m track win, he’s definitely going to get a DWTS bid this fall. We think that he would be paired with Daniella Karagach.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I Told You America I Got This! <a href=#>#OlympicChampion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/boBOZv3650</a></p>— Noah Lyles, OLY (@LylesNoah) <a href=#>August 4, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-12-robert-irwin>12. Robert Irwin</h2><p>Since Bindi Irwin’s DWTS win in Season 21, fans have wanted her brother, Robert, to follow in her footsteps. There have been rumors for YEARS about Robert joining the show, but we’re hoping this year will actually be the year. We could see Robert paired either with a new DWTS pro, or returning pro Peta Murgatroyd.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Random moments… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KbItpOzsux</a></p>— Robert Irwin (@RobertIrwin) <a href=#>May 6, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-13-sha-carri-richardson>13. Sha’Carri Richardson</h2><p>Another track star set to earn a bid from DWTS is Sha’Carri Richardson. This track star competed in Paris in both Women’s 100 meters and 200 meters races. She rose to fame in 2019 after breaking the 100 m collegiate record at the NCAA Division I Championships. This race made her one of the ten fastest women in history, at only 19 years old. We think she’d be paired with Brandon Armstrong.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Running it back with <a href=#>@beatsbydre</a> 💘 My new campaign for Beats Solo 4 <a href=#>#beatspartner</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lhKXql4K2U</a></p>— Sha’Carri Richardson (@itsshacarri) <a href=#>May 5, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-14-matt-rife>14. Matt Rife</h2><p>Finally, DWTS always casts one celebrity that has either been apart of a scandal, or who has created a scandal. In 2023, Matt Rife gained national fame on TikTok, with his standup comedy crowd work. Since gaining fans on the platform, Rife embarked on a comedy tour and even released a Netflix special. Fans quickly turned on Rife due to his jokes about domestic abuse, as well as his anti-women remarks. We think he’d be paired with DWTS standout pro Rylee Arnold.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SHE’S GOTTA TELL THE STORY BETTER 😂😅😮‍💨✊🏾✊🏼 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3TrYooH1TI</a></p>— Matt Rife (@mattrife) <a href=#>July 24, 2024</a><p>What do you think of our picks?
