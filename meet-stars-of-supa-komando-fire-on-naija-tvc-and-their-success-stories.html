<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Meet stars of Supa Komando 'Fire on Naija' TVC and their success stories</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Featuring brand ambassadors <strong>Dotun</strong>, the Energy Gad, <strong>Cross</strong>, <strong>Erica</strong>, <strong>Saskay</strong>, and the latest addition, Neo Energy, the 'Fire On Naija' TVC explored a different theme. The TVC launched on Sunday, July 28, 2024 conveys a message of hope and resilience in the face of challenges while highlighting Supa Komando’s commitment to inspiring Nigerians to conquer their daily hustle.</p><p>The TVC has elicited positive reactions from netizens, resulting in people sharing their stories and inspiring others. In this blog post, we explore the background stories of the stars in the TVC and why they are a perfect reflection of the TVC’s messaging.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-eb037785-1193-4468-905d-ea48ff953fe1 data-caption="Oladotun Ojuolape Kayode aka Do2dtun The Energy Gad"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/64GktkpTURBXy85YzI2ZGFlZWQyMWI2YTI0YTg3YWI1ZjgzZTY2OGE0Ny5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBH7Cww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>Oladotun Ojuolape Kayode aka Do2dtun The Energy Gad</h3></p><p>From nurturing his childhood passion for radio to honing his skills and eventually becoming a celebrated on-air personality, earning multiple awards, and turning “Hype” into a commercial success, Dotun’s journey is a testament to his unique talent, drive, and resilience in carving his own path in the African entertainment landscape. Today, he is referred to as Nigeria and Africa’s No. 1 Hype Man & Media Dynamo, a result of his exponential growth, hyper-activeness, endearing attitude, and the energy he brings to his craft and everything he touches. All of which is a true reflection of the "Fire On Naija" spirit depicted in the Supa Komando TVC.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-61d86df5-451c-4aee-bfe1-4767ab674d42 data-caption="Erica Nlewedim aka Star Girl Erica"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/sXOktkpTURBXy9hYjczNmVkMDYzOGQzZTI0ZWVkZDE1NTFjMDg0MzA1OC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBKLCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>Erica Nlewedim aka Star Girl Erica</h3></p><p>A force to be reckoned with in both the entertainment industry and beyond, Erica was raised by her mum in Lagos and from an early age took an interest in acting and modelling. She received the Miss Photogenic award after competing in the Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria pageant in 2014. She has an unwavering passion for acting while also championing important social causes with her NGO. Her ability to pursue her passion from an early age and her dedication to achieving her dreams tie with the TVC’s urge to never give up till success is achieved.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-24695b03-effa-4f67-86d4-046a5287d251 data-caption="Ikechukwu Sunday Cross Okonkwo aka Cross Da Boss"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/mMfktkpTURBXy81M2NhZDQzNDgwNDVlOGNkNTgxNGEzYjMwMGJiNTE1MS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBKLCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Ikechukwu Sunday Cross Okonkwo aka Cross Da Boss</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>From his remarkable stint in BBNaija which launched his career as an actor and model, Cross has captured hearts with his charm and charisma. What most people don’t know is that Cross suffers from Dyslexia - a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. As an actor, this would have been a huge obstacle but his unyielding determination to succeed in the entertainment industry despite his disability serves as an inspiration to many aspiring talents, embodying the "Fire On Naija" message from Supa Komando’s new TVC.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-17f554d2-ea0f-46a6-ad3e-8e2e8ddb21b4 data-caption="Tsakute Ladi Jonah aka Saskay"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/DyHktkpTURBXy80YmRkM2NlZWY3NTZiNWFhMjhmNjBhMTA1NGRjMzE5Yi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBKLCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>Tsakute Ladi Jonah aka Saskay</h3></p><p>With her multifaceted career as a model-influencer-dancer-actress extraordinaire, Saskay serves as an embodiment of grace and inspiration to many. Before these, Saskay worked a 9 to 5 job with a digital marketing firm in Abuja. In 2015, while in school, she faced a significant setback when she was suspended, threatening her academic journey. Despite this challenge, she fired on and refused to give up on her educational pursuit. Her determination paid off, and in 2021, she obtained a degree in Fine Arts. Hers is a story of true resilience and the need to keep pushing even in the face of challenges, a perfect real-life example of the Supa Komando TVC tagline "Fire On Naija".</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2f8e7e51-6850-450c-87cc-fe0e13ec15ba data-caption="Emuobonuvie Neo Oliseh Akpofure aka Neo Energy"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/pN4ktkpTURBXy8wODcxYzE0MmNlZmE0NjgyN2FlMzQ3YmQyZTYxNzAzNS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBKHCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>Emuobonuvie Neo Oliseh Akpofure aka Neo Energy</h3></p><p>One of 20 children from a polygamous home, Neo is no stranger to hustling and the struggle to make ends meet. He was once a cab driver and a sketch artist but today, the former BBNaija housemate known for his unique style and infectious energy, is a talented actor and hype man. Neo's journey from humble beginnings to becoming a household name is nothing short of remarkable. His journey from humble beginnings to a sought-after actor keys perfectly into the messaging of the "Fire On Naija" TVC by Supa Komando.</p><p>Supa Komando’s use of these characters in their TVC speaks volume about their commitment to inspiring and motivating Nigerians despite their present realities. The diverse backgrounds from which these stars hail serve as testaments that dreams can truly become reality through hard work & dedication. Their presence in Supa Komando's latest TVC represents much more than just star power; it symbolises resilience against all odds – much like the ethos that defines Supa Komando itself.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>#FeatureByKomando</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8rrHErWSsrJGnwG67xWaqrqiRYriwucCnm6hllp6%2FpnnOp2SnmZmfrm7A1ZxkmqaUYsGpscirZKytk5iytL%2BMrKuoqpmawHC0l6euqmpg</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mackenzie-scott.html><span>←</span><span>MacKenzie Scott (Novelist and Philanthropist)</span></a>
