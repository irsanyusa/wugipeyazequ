Last month, Dunkin’ announced another signature drink with D’Amelio, the Charli Cold Foam.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In addition to fast-food joints, some fast-casual restaurants -- such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which has worked with Miley Cyrus, David Dobrik and more -- have invested in celebrity sponsorships in recent years.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult data indicates more sit-down chains, such as Panera Bread Co., should follow suit to bring in more Gen Z consumers.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Most restaurant and coffee chains are likely highly interested in that demographic, said Gary Stibel, founder and chief executive of the New England Consulting Group, which counts former executives from Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. as part of its restaurant practice.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The lifetime value of acquiring a Gen Zer today versus a baby boomer is huge,” Stibel said. “If they walk in the door, usually two or three others are with them. And if you can establish habits in their teens and 20s, those will carry into adulthood when they start families.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">At Chipotle, for instance, more than half of all customers are millennials and Gen Zers, said Candice Beck, senior manager of social and digital, in an email to Morning Consult, so the brand has a heavy digital presence, which is bolstered by celebrity menu items.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When Chipotle launched its “Guac is Extra But So Is Miley” burrito, inspired by Cyrus’ favorite order, the item generated more than half a million social engagements, 400 earned articles and 1.4 billion earned impressions, Beck said.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The risk of celebrities upstaging brands</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Brands, however, should avoid partnering with celebrities or influencers just to get in on the trend.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The worst thing to do is to invest in a celebrity and then not get the brand recognition,” Stibel said. “People need to be able to match the partner with the specific brand — not just say, ‘I know they represent somebody, but I don’t know who.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5iyrbHBq6CtsV2Xv6K6w2anmqqko7Kzv8eip2alk5m8r63LnapmrKKWw6q%2FjKyaqKyk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./3000-music-festival-attendance-drops.html><span>←</span><span>Music festival attendance drops | YouGov</span></a>
