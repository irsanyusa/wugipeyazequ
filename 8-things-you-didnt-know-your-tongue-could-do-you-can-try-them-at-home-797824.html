<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>8 Things You Didnt Know Your Tongue Could Do (You Can Try Them at Home)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Our tongue is&nbsp;an&nbsp;organ that we&nbsp;constantly use, but that we&nbsp;don’t pay much attention&nbsp;to. We&nbsp;use it&nbsp;for the most basic functions of&nbsp;human life, like eating and speaking, but there’s much more to&nbsp;it&nbsp;than we&nbsp;think. Your tongue actually has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;tricks under its sleeve (so&nbsp;to&nbsp;speak): for example, not many people know that it’s one of&nbsp;the most resilient and flexible organs in&nbsp;the human body.</p><p>We&nbsp;were surprised at&nbsp;how such a&nbsp;common organ, that we&nbsp;use every day, has so&nbsp;many surprises! So&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;share with you some curious facts about our tongue that you might not know and that caught our attention.</p><p><h2>1. Your tongue never gets tired, unlike your other muscles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b38/adc/76b29f5574aa8b875f1995f9d7.jpg><p>Have you noticed that despite the fact that your tongue is&nbsp;a&nbsp;muscle, it&nbsp;<a href=#>never</a> gets tired or&nbsp;sore? That&nbsp;is, of&nbsp;course, if&nbsp;you don’t suffer from any type of&nbsp;medical condition. Then, unlike the muscles of&nbsp;your legs or&nbsp;arms, which would hurt if&nbsp;you did a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;physical activity, your tongue can handle constant movement because it’s actually made of&nbsp;8&nbsp;muscles. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also extremely flexible because of&nbsp;that. Could that be&nbsp;why some of&nbsp;us never get tired of&nbsp;eating?</p><p><h2>2. Every tongue is&nbsp;different.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e37/f7d/c58dbe5354bbf20b58759e0bd5.jpg><p>Every single tongue is&nbsp;different and unique. Kind of&nbsp;like your fingers, your tongue has its own <a href=#>unique</a> print, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;method of&nbsp;identification. It&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;too pleasant, though. Can you imagine having to&nbsp;scan your tongue at&nbsp;the airport, instead of&nbsp;using your thumb?</p><p><h2>3. Can you roll your tongue?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc5/681/e0f32c559db20c1be6c71888e1.jpg><p>Scientists are still trying to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;logical explanation for the fact that a&nbsp;large percentage of&nbsp;human beings can roll their tongue to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;“u” shape, while a&nbsp;smaller percentage cannot. The main argument behind this suggests that it&nbsp;all comes down to&nbsp;<a href=#>genetics</a>, but <a href=#>studies</a> have been conducted where parents could not do&nbsp;it, and their children could. Other studies say that the <a href=#>language</a> you speak might play a&nbsp;role too. We&nbsp;can’t tell for sure yet what having this great gift depends&nbsp;on, but you can give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try and see if&nbsp;your friends can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;too.</p><p>There’s something else&nbsp;— a&nbsp;small percentage of&nbsp;people can also do&nbsp;the “clover leaf tongue.” It’s one of&nbsp;the rarest options of&nbsp;shapes that your tongue can make!</p><p><h2>4. Tongues don’t get tired, but they can get fat.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c4/aed/80dc745914903c6a4916bb94c7.jpg><p>Like we&nbsp;said in&nbsp;the first point, the human body suffers from constant exhaustion&nbsp;— and the exception to&nbsp;this rule is&nbsp;the tongue. Of&nbsp;course, that might lead some people to&nbsp;think that the tongue is&nbsp;constantly exercising and in&nbsp;shape, but in&nbsp;fact, just like any other muscle, your tongue <a href=#>can get fat</a> if&nbsp;you gain weight. Actually, snoring and sleep issues can be&nbsp;related to&nbsp;having a&nbsp;fat tongue!</p><p><h2>5. Your tongue doesn’t really sense different tastes in&nbsp;different areas.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/edd/62d/6259e25280bb878afa9dc7165d.jpg><p>Due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;poor translation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thesis, the most popular “<a href=# title=taste data-link=tag>taste</a> map” of&nbsp;the tongue was actually misunderstood. What we&nbsp;know as&nbsp;the areas where the tongue perceives tastes, like sweetness at&nbsp;the tip and bitterness in&nbsp;the back, is&nbsp;just not a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>German scientist <a href=#>David Hänig</a> presented his doctoral thesis in&nbsp;1901, in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;suggested that the tongue had more sensitive surface areas than others, but his work was misinterpreted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;graph he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;show those areas.</p><p>In&nbsp;1974, scientist <a href=#>Virginia Collings</a> confirmed that tastes can be&nbsp;detected by&nbsp;any part of&nbsp;the tongue. What varies from area to&nbsp;area is&nbsp;the intensity with which they are perceived. By&nbsp;the way, taste buds are actually nature’s way of&nbsp;<a href=#>saving our lives</a>, because they allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;identify bad or&nbsp;poisonous food before eating&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>6. It’s impossible to&nbsp;capture the flavor of&nbsp;something by&nbsp;just using your tongue.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9d/02e/702d505c12bb89edd94e1dee49.jpg><p>Tongue identifies tastes, not flavors. Aren’t those the same thing? Of&nbsp;course <a href=#>not</a>. Try eating candy by&nbsp;covering your nose. Your tongue will identify that it’s sweet, but you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell if&nbsp;it&nbsp;tastes like chocolate or&nbsp;strawberry, since distinguishing flavors is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the sense of&nbsp;smell, not taste. If&nbsp;you don’t have a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;candy nearby to&nbsp;try, think about the ugly feeling you get when you get the flu and your nose is&nbsp;congested. Then, when your sense of&nbsp;smell is&nbsp;blocked, it&nbsp;seems like the food you eat has no&nbsp;taste at&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>7. It’s the part of&nbsp;the body that heals the fastest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/37e/2d2/cb51425fb6ba2b8b2e9e1807cc.jpg><p>How many times have you bitten your tongue? Probably a&nbsp;lot, but after a&nbsp;few minutes you usually forget that it&nbsp;even happened. That’s because, thanks to&nbsp;<a href=#>saliva</a> and the tissues that make up&nbsp;the tongue, this is&nbsp;the part of&nbsp;the human body that heals the fastest. We&nbsp;don’t recommend testing out this point at&nbsp;home, though!</p><p><h2>8. The color of&nbsp;your tongue can tell you something about your health.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/296/bd9/8e620e5d1e89a8b6ba73966c82.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your tongue is&nbsp;a&nbsp;light pink color, then congratulations! It&nbsp;means you’re probably <a href=# title=healthy data-link=tag>healthy</a>. Otherwise, it&nbsp;<a href=#>might mean</a> you need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor to&nbsp;get checked. Colors might vary between different shades, and each one indicates something different. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very red, you could have anything ranging from a&nbsp;minor infection to&nbsp;heart problems. Yellow indicates stomach or&nbsp;liver problems, and white can indicate dehydration. You can check out this article from <a href=#>Bright Side</a> to&nbsp;find out what the color of&nbsp;your tongue can reveal about your current health.</p><p>Which tricks did you try doing while reading the article?
