Ticket prices are rapidly increasing, especially on resale platforms.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Concert tickets have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>increased by 35%</a> since 2019, according to Pollstar. And yet Catherine Yi, UTA’s talent strategy executive, noted that fans are willing to pay the price for the artists that they love — no matter how high the cost.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When people really care about a show, they will do whatever it takes to attend,” said Yi. “They’re going to splurge no matter what, and that includes buying resale, buying above face value.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Because fans are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>eager to acquire tickets</a> for acclaimed performers — think <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Taylor Swift’s Eras</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Beyoncé</a>’s Renaissance tours — they are more likely to divert to resale platforms for tickets. In fact, the live music report found that 45% of those who attend are somewhat-to-completely willing to pay above face value for a resale ticket.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jem Aswad, executive music editor at Variety, sees the trend but says this is so because “a lot of the time, there is no other option” for fans to purchase tickets.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With the prevalence of resale platforms today, fans have a reliable backup method of scoring tickets to their favorite shows, even if word is they’re “sold out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That’s the thing — no show is really sold out anymore,” said Yi. “If you can resell on Ticketmaster, there’s always an opportunity to buy tickets, which didn't exist before. That’s why people are like, ‘If I have the opportunity, I’ll pay for it.’ It’s just that you’re going to be paying above face value.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Combating this issue has proved difficult for major resellers. However, Robbie Brown, music agent and co-head of festivals at UTA, has seen progress, with the likes of Ticketmaster developing its Verified Ticket application that operates as a fan-to-fan validated purchase.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“[We] are seeing the primary ticketing sources offer a verified resale ticket,” he said. “I think the fan is comfortable knowing that if they buy it on demand, they’re getting the real thing, and I think that’s a step in the right direction.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Still, he acknowledged, the problem of verification persists. “It is infuriating, and no one seems to have a solution for it — although they are trying.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Now dig into the VIP+ subscriber report, with updated data ...</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/refer_SR_live_entertainment_v1-1.jpg alt="Read the Report" width=100% sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtrF7wqilnJ2iqXq1tcKknK1loKe2pLXNoGSrnaOWuaZ5zJqppJ2kYn5zf5RwcGlxYmh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guatemala-migration-economy-remittances.html><span>←</span><span>Guatemalan Migrants Want to End Their Dependence on the U.S.</span></a>
