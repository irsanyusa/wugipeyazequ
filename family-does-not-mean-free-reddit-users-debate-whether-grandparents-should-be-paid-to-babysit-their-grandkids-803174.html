Grandparents should get paid.
If&nbsp;you expect grandparents to&nbsp;watch your kids, you should expect to&nbsp;compensate. They may refuse compensation, but you should at&nbsp;least offer, especially if&nbsp;it’s on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ongoing basis (like a&nbsp;daycare setup) rather than just the occasional night out."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In&nbsp;cases like this, they are acting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nanny. If&nbsp;the parents can afford it&nbsp;and the grandparent could use the money, I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;good to&nbsp;pay them something. You are saving&nbsp;SO much not having to&nbsp;pay for child care. Now, if&nbsp;the grandpa or&nbsp;grandma is&nbsp;well off enough not to&nbsp;need the income, they may choose to&nbsp;decline. But watching a&nbsp;kid that much is&nbsp;really a&nbsp;job.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are babysitting the grandkids for a&nbsp;few hours every few weeks, then&nbsp;no, I&nbsp;wouldn’t expect there to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;payment.

It’s just a&nbsp;gesture of&nbsp;thanks and helps her restock her pantry after the kids have gone through&nbsp;it. She’s never asked for cash and I’ve never heard of&nbsp;her complaining to&nbsp;my&nbsp;siblings about not getting enough and&nbsp;I know one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;siblings who never gives her money for looking after his kid and she’s never complained about it&nbsp;to&nbsp;me.&nbsp;©&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>ero_senin05&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/a86/50a3b35777b1c93f4f30fe3405.jpg><p>I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I would only be&nbsp;okay with paying them if&nbsp;they’d otherwise need to&nbsp;work some other job to&nbsp;earn an&nbsp;income and have instead offered to&nbsp;watch my&nbsp;kid.
