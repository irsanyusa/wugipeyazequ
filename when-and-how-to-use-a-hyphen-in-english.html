A hyphen vs a dash is a punctuation mark that we use to join words or part of words. It looks like this: -. It is like a dash, and lots of people confuse them. But, a dash is used to separate words. And, a dash has spaces around it; a hyphen doesn’t.&nbsp;Today, we’re looking at how to use hyphens in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, so let’s begin.&nbsp;</p><p id=Hyphens-with-high-and-low><a href=#>Hyphens with two-word adjectives</a><br><a href=#>Hyphens with high and low</a><br><a href=#>Hyphens with numbers</a><br><a href=#>Hyphens with present and past participle</a><br><a href=#>Hyphens with compound words in English</a><br><a href=#>Hyphens vs dashes</a><a href=#><br></a></p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Hyphens-with-two-word-adjectives>Hyphens with two-word adjectives</h2><p>We use hyphens to join two-word adjectives before nouns. We call these compound modifiers and we use them when two words come together to make one adjective. We only use hyphens when the adjectives come before the noun. If they come after the noun, we don’t need a hyphen.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a <strong>family-friendly</strong> restaurant.<br>This restaurant is <strong>family friendly</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s an <strong>energy-efficient</strong> roof.&nbsp;<br>That roof is <strong>energy efficient</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>I like the <strong>on-campus</strong> flats better.&nbsp;<br>I like the flats <strong>on campus</strong> better.&nbsp;</p><p>Be careful!&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re using an adverb plus an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adjective to describe</a> something, you don’t need to use a hyphen.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a<strong> ridiculously hot </strong>day.&nbsp;<br>That’s a <strong>reasonably priced</strong> car.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hyphens with high and low</h2><p>We often use high- and low- to form compound adjectives. These words should be followed by a hyphen.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s a very <strong>high-energy </strong>child.&nbsp;<br>This is <strong>low-income</strong> housing.&nbsp;<br>That’s a <strong>high-quality</strong> jacket.&nbsp;</p><p>But, if the compound adjective comes after the noun, it doesn’t need a hyphen.&nbsp;</p><p>This jacket is <strong>high quality</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Hyphens-with-numbers>Hyphens with numbers</h2><p>If we use a number and an adjective to form a <strong>two-word</strong> adjective, we also need to use a hyphen. This is true when the number is the first part of the adjective, and when the adjective comes before the noun.&nbsp;</p><p>A <strong>four-sided</strong> shape<br>A <strong>one-person</strong> ride<br>A <strong>seventeenth-century</strong> painting</p><p>We use hyphens when we write the numbers from twenty-one to ninety-nine.&nbsp;</p><p>I bought <strong>seventy-three</strong> bars of chocolate.&nbsp;<br>Were you born in nineteen <strong>eighty-seven</strong>?</p><p>It must be about two hundred and <strong>thirty-four</strong> degrees there.&nbsp;</p><p>When we use fractions as part of a compound adjective, for example, half or third, we use hyphens.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a <strong>half-baked</strong> idea.&nbsp;<br>She gave me <strong>one-third </strong>of her money.<br><strong>Three-quarters</strong> of voters want the President to resign.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Hyphens-with-present-and-past-participle>Hyphens with present and past participle</h2><p>We use hyphens when we combine a noun or adjective with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">present participle</a> to form a describing word. A present participle is a word ending -ing. For example:</p><p>That’s a <strong>gorgeous-smelling</strong> perfume.<br>He’s a <strong>hungry-looking</strong> crocodile.&nbsp;</p><p>We also use hyphens when we combine a noun and a past participle to form a describing term. A past participle is the third form of the verb, and regular ones end in -ed.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a<strong> family-owned</strong> hotel.&nbsp;<br>It’s a <strong>community-run</strong> project.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=Hyphens-with-compound-words-in-English>Hyphens with compound words in English</h3><p>Compound words are made when two words form another. Sometimes they have a hyphen, and sometimes they don’t. The best place to check this is in a dictionary. There are three types of compound words: open, closed and hyphenated.&nbsp;</p><p>Open compound words remain as two words:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>hot dog</li><li>peanut butter</li><li>ice cream</li></ul><p>Closed compound words do not have a space or a hyphen between them:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>firefighter</li><li>railway</li><li>snowball</li></ul><p>Hyphenated compound words have a hyphen between them:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>father-in-law</li><li>check-in</li><li>over-the-counter</li></ul><p>These words can change over time. The word <strong>well-being</strong>, as in “The <strong>well-being</strong> of employees is important to a company”, has a hyphen in most dictionaries. But, it is often written as <strong>wellbeing</strong> now, even by large companies and in academic articles.<strong> E-mail </strong>becoming <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">email</a></strong> is another example. Whoever said English was hard to learn?!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hyphens with prefixes and suffixes</h2><p>Prefixes and suffixes are not usually hyphenated. But, some common prefixes we use hyphens with are ex-, all- and self-, and the suffixes -elect and -free.&nbsp;</p><p>My <strong>ex-boyfriend</strong> is married with four children now.&nbsp;<br>It’s an <strong>all-encompassing</strong> look at the life of a great man.&nbsp;<br>A little bit of <strong>self-reflection</strong> would be good for you.&nbsp;<br>The <strong>President-elect</strong> is giving a speech.&nbsp;<br>It’s a <strong>sugar-free</strong> drink.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Using hyphens for clarity</h2><p>Sometimes, we use a hyphen to make sure the meaning of something is clear, or to make a word easier to read.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a big difference between these two sentences:&nbsp;</p><p>Are you going to <strong>resign</strong> from your job?<br>Are you going to <strong>re-sign</strong> your contract?&nbsp;</p><p>In the second sentence, the hyphen makes it clear that the meaning is sign again, and not quit like in the first sentence.</p><p>We also do this when there is an awkward combination of letters:&nbsp;</p><p>I think we should <strong>re-elect</strong> the Chairwoman.&nbsp;<br>He lives <strong>semi-independently</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these rules about hyphens are hard and fast: you shouldn’t mess with them! But some, like with compound words, are changing and the best place to check if you’re not sure how to use a hyphen is a good old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">(online) dictionary</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Hyphens-vs-dashes>Hyphens vs dashes</h2><p>A dash (also called em dash) is used to express parenthetical statements in informal writing. You use them in the same way as you’d use brackets. The dash is meant to emphasize your sentence.<br>Sometimes, a dash can also replace commas or colons</p><p>John is taking his kids (all 4 of them) to school.<br>John is taking his kids — all 4 of them — to school.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cdd8ca3ff0ffd753048a7037fbc1463b?s=240&d=mm&r=g2x" height=120 width=120 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Laura Lingoda</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
