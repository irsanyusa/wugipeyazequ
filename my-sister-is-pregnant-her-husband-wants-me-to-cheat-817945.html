The same happened to&nbsp;our today’s heroine. A&nbsp;woman, 29, came to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;tell people about her absolutely insane relationship with her sister and her sister’s husband. She’s at&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss, because she never expected that she would become an&nbsp;apple of&nbsp;discord between them.</p><p><h2>The woman’s attitude to&nbsp;her sister’s husband has never been positive.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd5/c5a/8a2b5a5e46882f51bb3f493e38.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman has recently come to&nbsp;Reddit and made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a> about her absolutely dubious family situation. She has literally appeared «between two fires» and doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;now.</p><p>The OP&nbsp;started her post, saying, «I’m not sure exactly where to&nbsp;post, but my&nbsp;friend recommended this sub as&nbsp;she listens to&nbsp;the podcast. Throwaway and fake names.»</p><p>She started her story, telling about her sister’s <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> background. She wrote, «My&nbsp;sister’s husband won’t leave me&nbsp;alone, my&nbsp;sister refuses to&nbsp;see reason because she’s pregnant. Me&nbsp;(29F) and my&nbsp;husband (30M) recently got married in&nbsp;early October, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful ceremony. My&nbsp;sister „Stacy“ (22F) walked me&nbsp;down the aisle as&nbsp;my&nbsp;father sadly passed of&nbsp;cancer and couldn’t.»</p><p>But the family idyll stopped at&nbsp;this point. The OP&nbsp;confessed, «Stacy was unhappy in&nbsp;her marriage to&nbsp;„Jack“ (32M) who tried to&nbsp;convince me&nbsp;to&nbsp;let her „remarry“ him during my&nbsp;ceremony.»</p><p><h2>Stacy’s husband appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not a&nbsp;very good person from the start.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31d/741/16fbfe54488e4d3fb8a5290d1e.jpg><p>Jack, the husband of&nbsp;OP’s sister, appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not a&nbsp;very good husband for Stacy. The OP&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Stacy came to&nbsp;me&nbsp;a&nbsp;few weeks after my&nbsp;wedding, and said she was going to&nbsp;divorce Jack. I&nbsp;fully supported her, and offered her a&nbsp;room in&nbsp;my&nbsp;home. Fast-forward to&nbsp;her twenty-second birthday, in&nbsp;me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband’s backyard during a&nbsp;barbecue, she announced she was pregnant.»</p><p>The news about <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> were shocking for the rest of&nbsp;the family. The woman wrote, «Me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband were dumbstruck, and after the congratulations and hugs, I&nbsp;pulled her inside to&nbsp;my&nbsp;bedroom.»</p><p>«I&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;she was still on&nbsp;her birth control, and she said she was. Then I&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;she was going to&nbsp;keep the baby, and she said yes. I&nbsp;asked about her divorce, and she said it&nbsp;was „a&nbsp;sign“ to&nbsp;tough things out.»</p><p><h2>The whole story took a&nbsp;really horrible twist later.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d85/e4b/c1342e5fff8a94187a0b2e223f.jpg><p>The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that very unhealthy things started happening when she unblocked Jack. She said, «Fast forward to&nbsp;last weekend, when Jack texted&nbsp;me. (I&nbsp;unblocked him to&nbsp;help with the pregnancy). He&nbsp;sent me&nbsp;provocative photos, asking to&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;at&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel sometime.»</p><p>«I&nbsp;immediately showed my&nbsp;husband, and asked my&nbsp;sister if&nbsp;she could meet up&nbsp;with&nbsp;us tomorrow. My&nbsp;husband was enraged, and threatened Jack, (to&nbsp;me&nbsp;at&nbsp;least) but&nbsp;I calmed him down. I&nbsp;took pictures of&nbsp;what Jack sent, and blocked him (for the hundredth time, it&nbsp;feels like).»</p><p>But her sister’s reaction was just unreasonable. The woman said that, surprisingly, her sister started acting as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she was her enemy. She wrote, «When my&nbsp;sister came, we&nbsp;showed her the pictures, and she was silent, before she burst into tears, yelling that&nbsp;I was a ‘homewrecker’ and ‘jealous of&nbsp;her child’. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;calm her down, and so&nbsp;did my&nbsp;husband, but she stormed out.»</p><p>«Since then, Jack has been sending provocative pics daily, using fake numbers, emails, even Stacy’s phone as&nbsp;he&nbsp;knows&nbsp;I won’t block her. I’m at&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss, my&nbsp;sister refuses to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;me, her husband Jack is&nbsp;harassing&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;MY husband is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;criminal if&nbsp;Jack doesn’t stop (ok&nbsp;that last one’s a&nbsp;joke, my&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;a&nbsp;saint).»</p><p><h2>People of&nbsp;Reddit delivered some nice advice for the desperate woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b95/d09/ae649a55378012eed588b6bb45.jpg><p>Redditors were quick to&nbsp;react to&nbsp;the woman’s desperate plea for help.</p><p>One user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «I’m fairly sure in&nbsp;most western countries you can get him arrested for constantly spamming your phone with that photos. That has to&nbsp;breach into harassment at&nbsp;some point. You should go&nbsp;that route. Not sure you can do&nbsp;much about your psycho sister.»</p><p>Another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, «Yep, at&nbsp;the very least I’d charge him with intimidation/stalking. OP, take those texts to&nbsp;your county courthouse and request a&nbsp;Personal protection order/restraining order. He&nbsp;will panic and drop fast.<br>Law enforcement, I&nbsp;deal with this a&nbsp;lot. Protect yourself and keep your hubby from doing something less than legal to&nbsp;this bad person.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story from a&nbsp;woman, whose husband made her do&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>paternity test</a> for their daughter, and it&nbsp;turned negative, but she swears she never cheated on&nbsp;him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKiqq2domK2tHnPq5ygppGjwW60xKtkoa2jl66vsIywmKeso2K6pnnTqGScoJWWwW6EkHBwbW1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lobservatoire-de-la-laicite-constate-que-tout-va-plutot-mieux-sauf-exceptions.html><span>←</span><span>L'Observatoire de la lacit constate que tout va plutt mieux, sauf exceptions...</span></a>
