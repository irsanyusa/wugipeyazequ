She rapped to her version of “I Love It” by Kanye West and Lil Pump. All three judges Gue Pequeno, Elettra Lamborghini, and Morgan turned their chairs for her after hearing her vocal skills. Elettra even yelled at her co-stars because she really wanted Hindaco on her team.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>‘THE VOICE’: GWEN STEFANI AND BLAKE SHELTON FIGHT OVER THIS CONTESTANT.</a></p><h2>Who is Hindaco?</h2><p>Elettra can be seen multiple times yelling at Gue Pequeno for turning his chair. The 24-year-old rapper decided to go with Gue as her coach for the show instead. Hindaco, who felt bad for not choosing Elettra, gave her a hug and was eventually carried off by Elettra in a playful manner. Gue has called Hindaco, “a semi-professional” and admitted he had watched her on YouTube before her audition so he was already aware of her talents.</p><p>The 24-year-old, Ilaria Amagour, is originally from Milan, Italy. Amagour has always been into rap music and Hip Hop, which makes sense as to why she decided to choose her coach during the competition. Despite the fact that she got such praise from three of the coaches at the blind audition, her time on ‘The Voice Italy’ was filled with criticism for her looks as well as her rapping. Many viewers felt that she wasn’t as good as other rappers that have been seen on the famous competition show. Despite her negative comments from viewers and not making it too far in the competition the young rapper continues to perform.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>INSECURE AND EMBARRASSED 13-YEAR-OLD HAS COACHES FIGHTING OVER HIM AFTER THIS PERFORMANCE [VIDEO]</a></p><h2>Where is She Now?</h2><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>The 24-year-old continues to create rap and hip hop music and has dropped a couple of singles such as “Cocco,” “Bulo,” “In the Juggle,” and many more. Right now, she has 22,000 followers on YouTube, and her studio version of “I Love it” has 199,000 views.</p><p>Amagour also has grown a good following on social media, with 29,000 Instagram followers where she posts about her music and many other business ventures. Aside from singing, she can be seen on Instagram modeling for many other companies such as Versace, off white, Marie Claire, Puma, and the North Face.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/livia-the-elementals-x-factor-uk.png alt="Contestant’s Odd Cirque Du Soleil Performance Bores Simon Cowell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blind auditions</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice italia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmec6fZKKskaHGbrbUnZ6eq12btqi002amr52iYsawwc2gZJ%2BdnZa5pnnRmqepnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./singapores-1965-to-shoot-from-november-1201296693.html><span>←</span><span>Singapores 1965 To Shoot From November</span></a>
