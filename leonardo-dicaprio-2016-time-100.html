But I admire him even more for putting those formidable tools toward becoming such a galvanizing force to protect our planet. Since 1998, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has provided grants to conservation projects in more than 44 countries. He has employed his cinematic skills—in front of the lens and behind it—to make films that document our planet’s plight. He has discussed environmental threats directly with world leaders from Vladimir Putin to Pope Francis. And when I invited him to join the State Department’s first global Our Ocean conference, aimed at building collaboration to protect one of our most critical resources, Leo didn’t just show up—he put up millions of dollars for ocean protection as part of the effort.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Leo captured the hearts of millions of moviegoers by declaring, “I’m the king of the world!” Through his work and example, today he’s inspiring many millions more to help save it.</p><p><i>Kerry is the U.S. Secretary of State</i></p><a href=# class=clipper-toggle>Tap to read full story</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilZqifqMFwgJFyb2tqZWS5prvNmqmdp12ZtqStz6ugqGViZX53edOipJ5lYWV9cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./next-generation-leaders.html><span>←</span><span>Florence Pugh Might Save the Movie Star From Extinction</span></a>
