<a href=../../../../hong-kong-apartments-property-sale-rent-small-housing.html></a>
Manhattanites, think those 300-sq.-ft. apartments in the Big Apple are small? Please.
One property project under development in suburban Hong Kong caused an uproar in the semiautonomous Chinese territory late November, when its developers revealed that the smallest studio suites in the completed apartment block would measure just 128 sq. ft. — or nearly 12 sq m.
No, that’s not a typo. A property developer in one of the world’s key financial hubs is offering apartments only two-fifths the size of what New York City’s then mayor Michael Bloomberg referred to as “micro-units.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Knicks basketball player shot, robbed outside strip club</h2><time>May 18, 2024</time>

Butker, who was the commencement speaker at the private Catholic college, was applauded at the ceremony, but his speech later sparked outrage and controversy online for its conservative discourse—particularly his remarks on women. At one point, he encouraged women to prioritize their “vocation” as mothers, wives, and homemakers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Viewpoint: Stephen Hawkings Israel Boycott Is Lost in Space</h2><time>May 18, 2024</time>

Israel has become the world’s premier nondestination for the smugly self-righteous. Since 2006, there has been a movement to boycott Israeli academic institutions organized by a coalition of Palestinian groups, to which people like Bono and Stevie Wonder have lent support. The latest to join this list is renowned scientist Stephen Hawking, who recently announced that he had refused an invitation to attend the Israeli Presidential Conference in late June “based on advice from Palestinian academics that he should respect the boycott.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why the A Wrinkle in Time Movie Will Change Hollywood</h2><time>May 18, 2024</time>
