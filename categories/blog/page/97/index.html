How will this decades long saga end? I’m not even going to guess. But with a universe spanning over 10 films with supplementary stories included, TV shows, books, graphic novels, and enough fan fiction to circle Tatooine five times, there is so much language to talk about.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Stores are Open on Thanksgiving?
