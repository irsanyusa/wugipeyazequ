Helen Rosenthal and her family were held in a concentration camp in France before relocating to Cuba and later the U.S.</p><p>Max and Helen Rosenthal were key inspirations for the parental figures played by Boyle and Doris Roberts in “Raymond,” the enduring domestic comedy that was a cornerstone of CBS’ primetime revitalization in the late 1990s.</p><p>From his varied TV appearances, Max Rosenthal was known for his wry sense of humor, his natural frugality, warmth and curiosity. In January 2015, when Phil Rosenthal traveled to Miami to interview Norman Lear for an industry conference, Max and Helen accompanied him. Max was spotted during the day attending conference sessions with a yellow legal pad in hand, taking notes and cheering his son on from the sidelines during his Q&A with the famed producer and philanthropist.</p><p>In addition to his son, Max Rosenthal’s survivors include daughter-in-law Monica Horan, an actor and also a “Raymond” regular; a granddaughter, Lily; and grandson, Ben; as well as son Richard (who produces “Somebody Feed Phil”) and his wife, Karen and their children (Max’s grandchildren) Jack and Tess.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span></p><p>(Pictured: Phil Rosenthal and Max Rosenthal)</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-flex lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-flex-wrap-wrap lrv-u-justify-content-center" aria-labelledby><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Max Rosenthal,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Phil Rosenthal</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN9jq2taKaVrMBwucCxZKuno5q7tbTApWSdnZGZenqBjJ6tnqqpl7ylxYylpq%2Bdo2K%2FosXMqKWdZaCdtq15kGtqbmhga354g44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-agrements-de-logements-sociaux-en-hausse-dans-presque-toute-la-france.html><span>←</span><span>Les agrments de logements sociaux en hausse dans presque toute la France</span></a>
