You see, I caught Aunt Rita red-handed, , , and business partner. No one told me that he/she saw them. Neither did I see them just romancing or kissing; I caught them naked, having raw sex.</p><p>My uncle had travelled to South Africa on some business and from what he told me, his friend, who was more like a family member, was supposed to travel with him but had suddenly developed some strange ailment, so my uncle had to go alone.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the day it happened, I was supposed to go and visit my boyfriend, , and spend the weekend with him and told my aunt who gave me her permission. She was all alone at home as their three children are in school but I knew she could take care of herself.</p><p>But when I got to Kenny's place in Yaba, I met the shock of my life when I walked in and saw him with another girl on the bed. I was so devastated that I ran out of his apartment. I decided to go see a female friend and cry myself out. I was with for a while as she tried to comfort me but when it got late, I decided to go back home.</p><p>As I opened the gate into my uncle's house, the first surprise was seeing uncle Andy's Range Rover jeep parked in front of the house. This was not unusual though, but why would he still be in the house at almost 10pm, when my uncle was not around?</p><p>But I did not give it a serious thought until I walked into the sitting room to find his shoes and cap on the settee but he and Aunt Rita were no where to be found.</p><p>That was when the alarm bells began ticking in my head. I removed my shoes, and on tip toes, climbed the staircase towards the master bedroom and my worst nightmare was confirmed when I heard the unmistakable sounds of a couple making love. I stood there frozen but something compelled me and I mustered the courage to approach the room.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In their hurry, they must have forgot to lock the bedroom door because as pushed it open, I saw in the dim light, uncle Andy on top of Aunt Rita, humping away. I stood there for over a minute and they were so carried away and did not see me.</p><p>I sneaked away and decided to stay in the sitting room waiting for them to come down and almost an hour later, I saw them coming down the staircase laughing and behaving like teenagers in love.</p><p>They were both shocked to see me sitting there with tears in my eyes, looking up at them. My uncle's wife as well as Andy knew I must have seen them in action and since then, have been trying everything possible to get made to tell them how much I saw and begging me not to tell my uncle but I have kept mute all through.</p><p>I have lost all the respect I used to have for her and though I have not told anyone, I feel it would be unfair to keep such finding from my uncle.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Dear readers, on<a href=# id=0b8fadc9-77d5-5c6e-aa46-ee6fd877fb5b> Morning Teaser</a> today, we want you to put yourselves in Annette's shoes.
