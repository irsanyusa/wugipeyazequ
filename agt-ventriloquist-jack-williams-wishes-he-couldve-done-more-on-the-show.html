Williams is not the first ventriloquist that competed for AGT gold, but he’s definitely one of the most memorable. His season 17 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">audition</a> has mustered in over 1.8 million views on YouTube at the time of writing.</p><p>The ventriloquist from Indianapolis may not have the element of uniqueness to his act, but he makes up for it by being comedically entertaining. During the podcast, Williams revealed he has tried auditioning on AGT for several years, the first time being when he was 14 years old.</p><p>In the same vein, he thinks a lot of his success has to do with his TikTok following. For those who don’t know, the 25 year old has more than 1.3 million followers on the video streaming app, where he shares his comedic ventriloquist content. Ahead of the AGT competition, he went viral for throwing his voice online.</p><p>He’s glad none of his previous auditions made it, explaining that there is no way he would be ready during those times. Williams shared that a lot of preparation and last-minute adjustments had to be done during his AGT run. He also reveals that his semifinal performance was hard as he was controlling two puppets at the same time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Had a Friendly Rivalry With Celia Muñoz</h2><p>Although AGT is a true competition, Williams confirms that he and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celia Muñoz</a> were friendly. He was ultimately happy when she made it to the finals.</p><p>“She’s only been doing it for two years, but she’s Insanely good! As far as technicality goes.” Williams said praising Muñoz’s technique.</p><p>Having two ventriloquists compete at the same time has made AGT a challenging experience for Williams. He explained that he disagrees with Howie Mandel’s comment favoring Muñoz, since they’re very different types of ventriloquists. Since they have different backgrounds, Muñoz’s as an opera singer, and Williams with comedy, they shouldn’t have been judged the same.</p><p>Nonetheless, fans loved Williams’s run on this season of AGT. Fans hope to see both him and Muñoz in the upcoming spin off series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_KodiLee_Gabe-Ginsberg_Getty-Images.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Winner Kodi Lee Teases His First Music Video for Song ‘Miracle’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZq6Vo8GztcuoqK6ho6l6q63CpGSwoZyhtqK50mauoquYmsButMRmmqitnJnDpnnDqKWeZZ2kv6Z5zqdkraCVYsCpu9Zo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./starbucks-holiday-cup-christians.html><span>←</span><span>Why Some Christians Are Upset at Starbucks' New Holiday Cups</span></a>
