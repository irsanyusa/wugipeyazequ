Unfortunately, the road can be bumpy (literally and figuratively) so to ward off potential scrapes, bumps and breaks, it’s important to consider the best bike for your kid.</p><p>“It is very important that a bike fit the child riding it. Ensure proper bike fit by bringing the child along when shopping for a bike,” shares Ann Schroeppel, of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Safe Kids Worldwide</a>. “Select one that is the right size for the child, not one they will grow into.”</p><p>Of course, figuring out the best fit for your kid may feel overwhelming because so many types and brands are on the market. To help, we’ve rounded up some of the best kids’ bikes for multiple terrains and purposes, so they can safely travel from the mountains to the playground, and everywhere in between.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-kids-bike-ie-what-to-consider>How to choose the best kids’ bike (i.e., what to consider)</h2><h3>How old is your child?</h3><p>Your child’s age, height and experience are some things to consider when bike shopping. For example, your two-year-old will need a much different bike than your 12-year-old. “Some kids don't understand the pedaling motion until they're 4 or 5 years old,” says Libby McComb of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bicycle Habitat</a> in NYC and Brooklyn, NY.</p><h3>What safety features do I need for my child?</h3><p>Your child’s bike should have a sturdy frame, a reliable braking system, plus reflectors and lights for visibility at night. Depending on your child’s abilities and/or the type of bike they’re riding, they may want knee and elbow pads and even riding gloves. No matter the rider’s age, a protective helmet is always necessary when riding a bike.</p><h3>Should my kid get fitted for a helmet?</h3><p>Properly-fitted helmets can reduce the risk of head injuries by at least 45%, per Schroeppel, yet less than half of children 14 and under usually wear a bike helmet. It’s the best way to prevent head injuries and death, according to research by <a rel=nofollow href=#>SafeKids.org</a>, so make sure your child has the right size helmet and wears it whenever riding. “Your child’s helmet should meet the <a rel=nofollow href=#>U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> standards,” says Schroeppel. “When it is time to buy a new helmet, let your children pick out their own because they will be more likely to wear them for every ride.”</p><h3>Should I go to a local bike shop for expert advice?</h3><p>Even if you don’t buy your bike locally, visiting your local bike shop for advice is worth it. And, if you can, shopping locally can be a great way to ensure you can easily go back with questions about fitting for a bike.</p><h3>How much does my child weigh and how tall are they?</h3><p>How a bike fits your child is essential for safety. A bike that is too large or too small for your child will impact their ability to safely handle it. If a child’s feet are straining to reach the pedals, they can’t ride the bike. Likewise, if your child’s feet are dragging below them, on the ground.</p><h3>Does my child know how to ride a bike?</h3><p>Your child’s ability and, in some cases, agility are two factors to consider when purchasing a bicycle. “Once they get the hang of balancing, adding pedals into the mix is easy,” shares McComb.</p><h3>Should my kid test-ride a bike before I buy it?</h3><p>Yes. Like any vehicle, it’s always wise to have your child try out a bike before you buy it. “It's important to think about fit, but also about what kind of riding they're going to be doing and their confidence level,” says McComb. “If your child is already comfortable on a bike, you can go with something they’re just on the cusp of being big enough to fit on, size-wise, but if they're just learning, a slightly smaller bike is easier to manage.”</p><h3>Are electric bikes safe for kids?</h3><p>It depends on who you ask, but most electric bikes are not designed for kids. “We would not recommend electric bikes for most kids. Most have manufacturer warnings about being intended for adult use only,” says McComb. “They are often heavy and can be operated at higher speeds some riders are not ready for.”</p><h3>Does the bike come with a warranty and can I return it?</h3><p>Ask your seller about their return policy on bikes, as well as whether they offer a warranty period.</p><h3>Should I ask other parents about their experiences?</h3><p>Absolutely. Ask your friends and colleagues about the bikes that worked for their kids and ask why they chose a particular make and model. Go a step further, and ask if your children can try out the bikes, too.</p><h3>Ask your kid, ‘Why do they want a bike?’</h3><p>Ask your kids why they want one and how they will use it, suggests McComb. “Do they love biking? Do they want to go mountain biking? Do they want to do a bike tour? Ride to school? Think about how long they might have this bike for and how their use might change in that time,” she suggests. A kid who wants to spend weekends on the bike path but also wants to ride to school will need a hybrid model versus a mountain bike, for example.</p><h2 id=our-top-kids-bikes-picks>Our top kids’ bikes picks</h2><h3>Best bikes for ages 18 months to 5 years</h3><h3>Balance bike: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>12 Sport Balance Bike</a></h3><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/951d3efafa9e1355106885073af15f0c/860fe/12-Sport-Balance-Bike.png></span><p>The OG of balance bikes, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Strider</a> balance bikes remain popular for parents and kids.

Going to your local bike shop is a great one-stop shop where you can try out bikes and get advice tailored to your child before you buy one.</p><h2 id=are-electric-bikes-safe-for-kids>Are electric bikes safe for kids?</h2><p>Electric bikes for kids are a no, according to most bike experts. “I would say some pedal-assist (no throttle) class 1 e-bikes that are limited to less than 20mph are okay for older, adult-sized teens that are already very, very comfortable cyclists with excellent bike-handling skills, who can be trusted to operate them safely, but always wear a helmet and obey the rules of the road,” shares McComb.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>When do kids start riding bikes?</h3><p>Every child is different, and the age they start riding bikes depends on their development, says McComb. “Some kids don't take to a balance bike right away and prefer a bike with training wheels,” she says. Balance bikes can be for 18-month-olds and there are mountain bikes designed for as young as five years. However, when it comes to safety issues, age does matter.</p><p>“It can be hard for kids to judge speed and distance of cars until age 10, so limit riding to sidewalks (although be careful of vehicles in driveways), parks, or bike paths until age 10. No matter where you ride, teach your child to stay alert and watch for cars and trucks,” Schroeppel adds.</p><h3>How are kids’ bikes measured?</h3><p>When measuring for kids’ bikes, you measure the child’s inseam. So, you need to consider the height (not the age) of the rider as well as the size of the wheels. For example, a 20” kid bike would usually suit a six or seven-year-old and a bike for an 11-year-old will usually have bigger, 26” wheels.</p><h3>Which bike is best for a five-year-old?</h3><p>The best bike for a five-year-old will depend on the child. Some may still need a balance bike, and others will be ready for a bike with training wheels. In many cases, an experienced rider at five years can handle whatever bike fits them.</p><h3>What age should kids’ bikes have gears?</h3><p>There isn’t a specific age for kids and gears, but most bikes designed for seven or eight-year olds offer some gear options.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lm56xtHnBoqKeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bbnaija-2020-lucy-confirmed-she-had-feelings-for-me-praise.html><span>←</span><span>BBNaija 2020: Lucy confirmed she had feelings for me -Praise</span></a>
