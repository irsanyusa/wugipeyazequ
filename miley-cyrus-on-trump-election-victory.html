She also reiterated her support for Hillary Clinton, noting that she still thinks Clinton deserves to become the first female president.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“And that’s what makes me so sad,” she said, breaking down, “… that I just wish that she had that opportunity because she’s fought for so long. And because I believe her when she says she loves this country, this is all she’s ever done, she’s given her life to make it better. But like Donald Trump so ironically played after his speech, ‘You Can’t Always Get What You Want,'” she added, referencing the Rolling Stones song that Trump played following his victory address in Wednesday’s early hours.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She concluded with a plea: “Please just treat people with love, and treat people with compassion, and treat people with respect, and I will do the same for you,” she said, offering to be available for her fans. “If you want to open your mind and open your heart, I would love to give you a key. Thank you so much. Thank you Hillary for inspiring all of us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbWZphXl8jqagpZ2pYrC6vtSsZKimXam%2FtrnPZpylnZOptrC6jK%2BgnKyfp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1304813-rivers-cuomo-bio-age-height-wife-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rivers Cuomo bio: age, height, wife, net worth</span></a>
