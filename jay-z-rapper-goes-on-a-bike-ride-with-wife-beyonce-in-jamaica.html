Jay was on Jamrock just last year ... when he recorded with <strong>Damian Marley</strong> for the 4:44 album.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>With the tour which is set to kick off in June 2018, it is obvious the power couple have put aside all the cheating drama and are moving on. It would be recalled that back in November 2017, while granting an interview with <strong>Dean</strong><strong>Baquet</strong> from <strong>The New York Times</strong>, <a href=# id=765a1505-e27c-5f99-a799-8ac2f1440142>Jay Z explained why he cheated on Beyonce</a> and how they both used therapy to avoid divorce.</p><p>"You have to survive. So you go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode, what happens? You shut down all emotions. So, even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect. ... In my case, like, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity," he said.</p><p>Why Jay Z cheated on Beyonce</p><p>Jay Z also revealed how scars from the past made him push away Beyonce and led to his cheating on her. He revealed that he and Beyonce were planning to do a joint album which will serve as a form of therapy but her <strong>Lemonade</strong> album came out before the joint album they were working on.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Beyonce's sister, Solange attacks Jay Z</p><p>It would be recalled that back in 2014 during the <strong>MET Gala</strong>, Beyonce’s younger sister <strong>Solange</strong><a href=# id=45b1cff3-2907-5939-afcb-a30574942d9b>attacked Jay Z in the elevator</a>. Beyonce’s bodyguard restrained her but the pop star did nothing to stop her sister from attacking her husband.</p><p>It was rumoured that Solange attacked Jay Z because she found out that he was seeing <strong>Rachel Roy</strong> on the side. It was also said that Solange had an argument with Roy at the event before attacking Jay Z.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGajmalix26%2BwKmnnqpdnLymv4yopWaZXZe2rLGMq6CdnV2strW0jLCgn51dl7K6u82cnGahnmK3ornAopqaZ2WrurrCwbE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lancement-de-lappel-projets-innovants-jeunesse-du-programme-dinvestissements-davenir.html><span>←</span><span>Lancement de l'appel projets innovants jeunesse du Programme d'investissements d'avenir</span></a>
