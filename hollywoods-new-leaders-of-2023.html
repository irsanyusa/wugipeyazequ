But that doesn’t do full justice to the idea. True leadership involves setting an example and inspiring people to do their best work. And letting them do it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Or, in the words of the late astronomer and communicator par excellence Carl Sagan: “Being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Such an ethos explains the attitude of the TV executive on this list who finds reward in having taken a chance on hiring a TV director who ended up surpassing his expectations. And the film VP who mentors her juniors by encouraging them to ask questions and make mistakes. And the label exec who signs new talent on the basis of who they are as a person just as much as their music background.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The following list contains multiple examples of people who rose in their careers because they had the good fortune to work with bosses who let them fly and shine.

Bad Robot is working on diverse animation projects across film and TV, including a two-season order for Bruce Timm’s “Batman: Caped Crusader” at Amazon, and an adaptation of “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” for Warner Bros.</p><p><strong>Enduring power of animation: </strong>“I’ve seen such a resurgence and celebration of animation in different forms,” says Agbaje. “I could’ve never predicted we’d get films as diverse, technically impressive and creatively excellent as ‘Across the Spider-Verse,’ ‘Nimona,’ ‘Elemental,’ ‘Ninja Turtles,’ and our own Oscar-winning short, in the same 12-month period.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Maxime Cottray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Maxime-Cottray-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>COO<br>XYZ Films<br>(Film & TV)</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Newly appointed COO of the independent film studio XYZ Films, Cottray oversees the company’s financing, business affairs and day-to-day operations, as well as functioning as producer and executive producer for many of its titles. Cottray, 34, successfully raised the company’s multimillion-dollar production financing, established XYZ as a full-fledged independent studio and launched the company’s U.S. distribution. Cottray also initiated a collaboration between XYZ and the generative AI firm Flawless to create lip-synced versions of foreign-language films acquired for English-speaking territories.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Shrinking the world with AI:</strong> “AI can be used as a positive force to bring foreign-language content to a wider U.S. and global audience with the hope that the lip-syncing technology encourages consumers to no longer see these great movies as foreign and instead immerse themselves in new stories, cultures and filmmakers,” Cottray says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Nicole Foster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Nicole-Foster-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Senior Business Affairs Executive<br>Amazon MGM Studios<br>(Film & TV)</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Foster served as business affairs lead for titles such as “Red One,” “Candy Cane Lane,” “Red White & Royal Blue” and “My Spy 2.” She closed a multiyear first-look film deal with Macro and sealed the highly competitive rights deal for the universe-building graphic novel “Eight Billion Genies.” Additionally, Foster, 34, was a mentor for the Howard Entertainment Program — a partnership between Amazon Studios and Howard University designed to diversify the talent pipeline across entertainment — and served as professional development chair for the Los Angeles chapter of the Black Employee Network at Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Challenges of dealmaking: </strong>“Things are more exciting given our ability to contemplate wider theatrical releases on top of our standard streaming model,” says Foster, “and I’ve been challenged to creatively strategize a new approach to deal terms for the new model, while also staying both talent- and studio-friendly.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ryan Friscia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ryan-Friscia-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>EVP, Finance and Business Development<br>NEON<br>(Film & TV)</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As Neon pivots from acquisition to production, Friscia, 37, has played an integral role in helping fund that growth by arranging a $40 million credit facility with Comerica Bank. Since then, he has supervised the production financing of horror hit “It Lives Inside” and upcoming Hunter Schafer starrer “Cuckoo,” as well as helping Neon acquire the rights to Michael Mann’s “Ferrari.”</p><p><strong>Finance is king:</strong> “If our slate is 12 films a year, a good balance between production and acquisition is 50/50,” Friscia says. With Hollywood feeling the pressure of inflation, he sees the role of finance as increasingly critical: “Things are starting to cost more and everybody’s pulling back on their spend. Getting a grasp on a project’s finances will become even more important.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sarah Gabriel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sarah-Gabriel-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Head of Production & Development<br>Signature Films<br>(Film & TV)</strong><br>Since pivoting from film sales to creative development and production, Gabriel, 37, has played a key role in building Signature Films’ production division. Her approach was to start off small, making eight movies in the sub-$2 million range during the pandemic. Signature then worked with bigger budgets on 2022 black comedy “The Estate” and the upcoming crime drama “Marmalade,” before taking their biggest punt: “Trap House,” starring Dave Bautista, which carries a price tag “in the $40-to-$50 million range,” per Gabriel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Indie breeding ground: </strong>Gabriel attributes her seamless transition to production down to her diversified background. “It’s important to know how to make it work financially and understand the marketplace,” she says. “The best producers always come out of the independent space because they understand every aspect of how a movie gets made.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Toni Gutierrez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Antonia-Gutierrez-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Director of Development<br>Wind Sun Sky Entertainment<br>(Film & TV)</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Gutierrez oversees the Canadian animation studio’s diverse slate of multiplatform IP for kids, YA and adults, and is responsible for expanding the company’s deep creative roster and building commercial franchises for the global marketplace.

Last year, he and his team worked to secure the popular HBO/Max series “Generation” and “Lovecraft Country,” and titles like “Deadpool” and “Deadpool 2.” Tubi has surpassed 74 million monthly active users and logged nearly 4 billion streaming hours for the first half of 2023. Tubi also reached an impressive 1.4% of total TV viewing time, according to Nielsen’s July 2023 the Gauge report.</p><p><strong>The viewer rules: </strong>“I’d say the fun of my job is that I get to work with over 450 content partners,” Harowitz says. “It’s a huge win for TV viewers to access a show that previously had only been on HBO or HBO Max.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Dane Joseph</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dane-Joseph-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>VP, Unscripted Series<br>Hulu Originals<br>(Film & TV)</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Joseph helped to launch Hulu’s unscripted vertical, bringing the Emmy-nominated “Taste the Nation With Padma Lakshmi,” “Spotify Presents Rap Caviar” and the streamer’s most-watched unscripted series, “The Kardashians.” He aims for 100% of Hulu’s unscripted slate to have LGBTQ+, persons of color, women and people with disabilities in senior creative roles and on camera. Joseph, 39, takes this a step further with his involvement with the Yard Mentoring program, which focuses on Disney’s engagement with historic Black colleges and universities.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Resonating with audiences: </strong>“Real peo­ple are so beautifully complicated and real stories so engrossingly unpredictable,” says Joseph. “That’s why unscripted is such a core genre for many.

But he’s not resting on his laurels. He executive produces Jeff Bridges’ acclaimed FX series “The Old Man,” renewed for a second season, and is collaborating with K.J. Steinberg on adapting the Amanda Knox story for Hulu in what Littlefield calls a satisfying but unexpected way. He’s also hoping that “The Bends,” a drama pilot for FX, will get picked up.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Back to work: </strong>“We have to laugh about how many times ‘The Old Man’ has been shut down to external forces,” Littlefield says, referring to COVID, Bridge’s cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. “Right out of the gate [post strikes], we’re writing and prepping the rest of that season.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sherry Liu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sherry-Liu-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>SVP, Studio Franchise Strategy and Operations<br>Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon<br>(Film & TV)</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Liu, 38, works across Paramount Global to drive new business forward for its IP.
