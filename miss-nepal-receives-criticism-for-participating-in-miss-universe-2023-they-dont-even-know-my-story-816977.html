Long aspiring to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;model, she confronted previous challenges linked to&nbsp;low self-esteem. The overwhelmingly positive feedback she received during the competition became a&nbsp;validating moment, strengthening her newfound confidence to&nbsp;embrace her true identity.</p><p>“I&nbsp;came with a&nbsp;humble heart... but when&nbsp;I won on&nbsp;that stage, I&nbsp;got the loudest applause from the whole entire audience,” she revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c0/c7f/3b1d4b5c318367af89fcbc0748.jpg><p>Moises Castillo / Associated Press / East News</p><p>Garrett <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a> that she was taken aback by&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;applause she received on&nbsp;stage. She clarified that she had no&nbsp;specific expectations and was participating solely to&nbsp;represent her country and women worldwide. “It&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;breakthrough moment for me&nbsp;and for <a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a> that they see something different and real size beauty,” she shared.</p><p><h2>Opinions were mixed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/192/69d/d784305e7f8ee42abce4881009.jpg><p>While receiving admiration worldwide for her stunning appearance, the 23-year-old revealed she encountered substantial criticism. She acknowledged that some incoming messages were far from positive. Jane <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “I&nbsp;see things like, ’Oh, she’s a&nbsp;whale,’ or ’Why don’t you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the gym?’ And things like that.” She continued, “It’s like they don’t even know my&nbsp;story. They don’t even know what I’m going through.”</p><p><h2>She is&nbsp;pursuing her dreams despite the challenges she faces.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b6/5d0/aee5a05440847e16001d86c6d0.jpg><p>The beauty contestant explained that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deals</a> with a&nbsp;condition called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)</a>. This health condition involves the ovaries producing higher levels of&nbsp;androgens than usual in&nbsp;women. PCOS can lead to&nbsp;different effects, such as&nbsp;weight gain, irregular menstrual cycles, <a href=# title=acne data-link=tag>acne</a>, and increased hair growth. “The other thing is&nbsp;mood swings, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fatigue. So&nbsp;every day, like, it’s very difficult because we&nbsp;just continuously feel tired,” Jane <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce5/eb2/89a0e655539396bfeb4034bc32.jpg><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> that her condition had caused significant weight gain recently, which affected her mental well-being and self-esteem. Despite this, Garrett embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey to&nbsp;foster a&nbsp;positive mindset and embrace her identity. Witnessing her confident presence on&nbsp;stage clearly shows she has triumphed in&nbsp;this path of&nbsp;self-acceptance.</p><p>Miss Nepal looks stunning, and it’s a&nbsp;noteworthy step for the Miss Universe competition to&nbsp;embrace and honor the beauty and diversity of&nbsp;women’s bodies, acknowledging different shapes and sizes.
