Temperatures are forecasted to reach as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the Bay Area. Surrounding desert and mountainous regions in Los Angeles could see even greater numbers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other regions of the U.S., including the Southern Plains and Southeast are also under similar heat alerts.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Excessive heat warnings mean that temperature highs could cause “life-threatening impacts” or other “major impacts to commerce or travel,” <a href=#>per the NWS</a>. More people die from extreme heat <a href=#>than any other</a> weather-related event.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Californians are bearing the brunt of the heat, with those in the interior valleys seeing the greatest rise in temperature, per Accuweather. The blistering heat also arrived as workers attempted to subdue the Thompson forest fire, which has <a href=#>burned 3,000 acres</a> thus far, forcing some 13,000 residents to flee from their Northern California home. The fire was 0% contained Wednesday morning.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It's going to be downright hot across the Southwest, especially in California and the Desert Southwest where record highs will be challenged," said Accuweather Senior Meteorologist Joseph Bauer in a <a href=#>press release</a>. Further east, other cities like Little Rock, Ark. are expected to reach a <a href=#>heat index</a> of 113 degrees on Thursday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The NWS Prediction Center said that the excessive heat highs near the Pacific <a href=#>could continue</a> through July 11, with other states like Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Idaho also within reach of an excessive heat high.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=#>What to Know About Heat Domes—and How Long They Last</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The NWS of Las Vegas has asked people to bring their pets indoors. “Yes, the Mojave Desert gets hot. But this heat will be record-breaking,” the office <a href=#>tweeted</a> on Wednesday. Cooling centers <a href=#>opened</a> in metros like Los Angeles starting Wednesday through July 8.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The NWS of the Bay Area <a href=#>advised people</a> to avoid using fireworks—a staple of this holiday season, amidst the heat. “Rapidly developing drought conditions across the mid-Atlantic and Southeast will make it easier for fireworks to spark brush fires, especially with very little rain expected in the days leading up to July 4,” added Accuweather Senior Meteorologist Brian Thompson.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Millions of others along the northern Plains to the Midwest will contrastingly be impacted by thunderstorms, Accuweather reports. States like Minnesota have already been impacted by what could be the worst flooding in nearly 60 years, <a href=#>according to the Star Tribune</a>. Floodwaters are so strong in some areas that the authorities say the Rapidan Dam is in “imminent failure condition,” posing a risk to thousands of residents.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlphnOFjrCfmqxdqMGiwMSsZKGdkal6orjEq6usZZqqubp5k2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whats-open-and-closed-on-easter.html><span>←</span><span>Everything That's Open and Closed on Easter 2019</span></a>
