For one thing, they sent a message to the rest of the world. She “put great stock in the politics of respectability,” Bercaw says, using propriety to protect herself and others from negative stereotypes about African-American women. But they also sent a message to those Tubman helped, demonstrating that all people deserved the respect signified by elegance. “It was very important to her to serve tea in a proper setting, demonstrating a common humanity and respect, of all individuals,” Bercaw says, “and I think some of her clothing was also speaking to that, an inherent human dignity.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bercaw adds that she hopes that this Harriet Tubman Day more people will remember the work Tubman did later in her life, in her wearing-white phase, and how she helped care for the elderly.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think people forget about the second half of her story—what happens to people when they become free?” she says. “Slavery was still continuing in people’s lives.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction: </strong>The original version of this story misspelled Nancy Bercaw’s name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbmlsgnWFjqGYq6qZmsFuwNSbpJqmXZmuuns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deja-voodoo-dan-rostenkowski-proposes-a-grand-budget-compromise.html><span>←</span><span>Deja Voodoo?
