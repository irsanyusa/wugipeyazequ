If you don't know which doughnut you should order, why not try deciding based on the <a href=# id=346a1e0b-849a-323c-abc8-4ade9050e15a>tastes your zodiac sign prefers?</a></p><p>According to astrologers, each zodiac sign has a unique flavor palate. So whether you're a health-conscious Virgo or an indecisive Gemini, the personality traits of your sign can help you figure out which type of treat you may want to try next.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here's which doughnut you might want to try ordering based on your zodiac sign.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>An Aries might appreciate the sweetness and spiciness of a cinnamon-sugar doughnut</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="cinnamon sugar donut"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/hxVktkuTURBXy9hYmVmODhkMS00ZjJjLTQxMTEtOGQ1YS01Yzk2ZWFiZGM4ZDEuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0CRsLD></span><p>As the most adventurous sign of the zodiac, Aries tend to crave bold flavors almost as much as they desire exciting experiences that incite "childlike joy," which is why <a href=# id=5b54370f-f902-3ecf-a8b3-8d9b8cd9b64b>astrologer Nadiya Shah</a> suggested people with this fire sign order a cinnamon-sugar treat that delivers a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of spiciness.</p><p>"[Aries] is a sign that rules spicy flavors," Shah told INSIDER, "Choose cinnamon-sugar doughnuts for the touch of the distinct, fiery taste, perhaps with a strong, sweet icing for the quick energy your sign craves."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>Tauruses might appreciate the taste of a doughnut filled with chocolate cream</h3></p><p><a href=# id=a2239d9c-af35-3b16-a825-6c3beea7b1f3>Olga Verk</a> , an astrologer and writer based in Monterey, California, told INSIDER that Tauruses are "true foodies" who look for the simple, yet delicious, flavor a doughnut filled with chocolate cream can supply.</p><p>That being said, Tauruses aren't all about the way a food looks so they probably won't choose a doughnut just because it looks pretty. "Presentation isn't as important to them as the actual taste and they love to taste different levels of flavors," Verk said.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>A Gemini might enjoy the variety that a cronut provides</h3></p><p>"As the sign of the twin, the cross between a doughnut and croissant is perfection," said Virginia Paciocco, the in-house astrologer at <a href=# id=3599312c-8372-3fe4-a4e7-4184235f4754>Spirit & Spark</a> . "They get both cravings satisfied."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>Cancers will probably appreciate a seasonal flavor like pumpkin spice</h3></p><p>Cancers are the most sentimental zodiac sign so chances are they'll find value in flavors that are unique to specific seasons.</p><p>Verk told INSIDER that a Cancer will most likely order for the limited-edition, seasonal sweets, like pumpkin-spice doughnuts, so they will feel "nice and fuzzy on the inside" with every bite.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>Leos may enjoy the laidback flavor of a toasted-coconut doughnut</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Leos typically like to take it easy, so when life gets hectic, Shah said they're most likely to scope out foods that both taste good and make them feel cool, calm, and collected as though they are on a vacation.</p><p>Shah said the tropical flavors of a toasted-coconut doughnut might make Leos feel nice and relaxed.</p><p>"Leos are the sign of laidback confidence, sunny weather, and relaxation," Shah told INSIDER. "Tropical environments are some of their favorite places to be."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>Virgos might keep their order simple with an old-fashioned doughnut or some doughnut holes</h3></p><p>Virgos are known as being the most health-conscious of the zodiac signs and this may be reflected in the treats they choose to indulge in.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can probably expect this earth sign to order something simple, like an old-fashioned doughnut, or something small but satisfying, like a bite-sized doughnut hole or two.</p><p>"[Virgos] love having their bodies and surroundings kept clean and they have the willpower and self-discipline to keep themselves from overindulging," Verk said.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-27>Libras might choose a strawberry-frosted doughnut with sprinkles because it looks and tastes delicious</h3></p><p>Unlike Tauruses who value flavor more than aesthetic, Libras tend to favor whichever treat is most pleasing to the eye. The doughnut they choose will probably be whichever looks the prettiest on the shelf.</p><p>Verk said that even though Libras "are not big fans of bright colors," they do tend to lean toward classic flavors. And so, Verk told INSIDER that a classic, strawberry-frosted doughnut might satisfy their cravings.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-30>Scorpios may appreciate the intensity of a glazed, chocolate-cake doughnut</h3></p><p>Scorpios are known for being the most intense of the zodiac signs and they have a certain depth and sense of richness about them.</p><p>"Outside of such ethereal qualities, [Scorpios] will likely choose the forbidden fruit above and beyond anything," Shah told INSIDER. She said a dark-chocolate doughnut made out of cake is a delectable choice that's perfect for Scorpios.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-33>Those who are Sagittarius may find joy in a glazed, fruity doughnut</h3></p><p>Paciocco told INSIDER that a Sagittarius typically finds joy in humor and fun so their ideal treat is likely something that's fruity and glazed, such as a lemon-filled doughnut.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-35>Capricorns might opt for the popular choice a traditional, glazed doughnut</h3></p><p>Capricorns are known for being the most ambitious and dedicated members of the zodiac. Anyone born under this earth sign strives toward greatness, which is exactly why they'll lean towards a foolproof glazed doughnut.</p><p>"[Capricorn] is the sign of the CEO and the boss," explained Shah. "They will most likely find <a href=# id=b564f5c8-e17c-3c66-a82f-5e2e7db2ba15>the most popular doughnut</a> , the glazed, to be among their favorite, for its ability to be a beloved and widely pleasing treat."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-38>Aquarians may want something truly special, like a Boston-cream doughnut</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Aquarians are known to be rooted in rebellion. Shah told INSIDER these individuals tend to desire social change and revolution.</p><p>Because of this, a Boston-cream doughnut may be a great choice for Scorpios because it played a role in "evoking the start of a movement," a <a href=# id=f2599385-060d-3b5c-aab9-65512689066a>cream-filled doughnut</a> movement, that is.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-42>A Pisces go-to doughnut might involve a jelly filling or a cream filling</h3></p><p>Pisces like to experiment "due to their creative nature," Verk told INSIDER. She said their go-to doughnut probably includes something special, like a filling.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Pisces' nature is pretty guarded to the outside world, but their inner world is always filled with ideas and emotions," Verk said. Therefore, a powdered, jelly-filled doughnut or a Bavarian-cream doughnut might be their go-to order.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme9OhnGacn6q0qbrUrWSyp6ViwKm71KWbZqeimbKzecGaqp6cXaS7bsXOrqlmsp%2BZtqKvjKygoKZfoK%2B5wNGfaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./regards-croises-transition-numerique-des-collectivites-ou-en-est-lusage-du-saas-en-2023.html><span>←</span><span>o en est l'usage du Saas en 2023 ?</span></a>
