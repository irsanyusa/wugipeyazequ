<a href=../../a-dance-to-the-music-of-time-1951-by-anthony-powell.html></a>
The words “twelve-novel cycle” don’t exactly inspire readerly zeal in most people, but once you catch the rhythm of Powell’s dodecahedral masterpiece it’s hard to put it down. Beginning in the 1920’s, A Dance to the Music of Time follows the lives of a group of English friends and acquaintances as they make their various ways through life: meeting and parting, succeeding and failing, loving and hating, living and dying. There is ample room for both comedy and tragedy in this capacious, large-hearted work, but Powell’s real triumph is the way he catches the rhythm of fate itself, the way it brings people together, only to spin them apart, then reunite them later as near-strangers, transformed in unexpected ways by the intervening years.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Asa - Beautiful Imperfection [10th Anniversary Review]</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>

Asha’s release coincided with Nigeria finding the earliest traits of its mainstream pop sound after Timaya’s debut album, True Story dropped. However, the soundscape was still largely formless. Hip-Hop was creating pop blueprints and a lot of Nigerian superstars like 2Face, D’Banj, 9ice, Olu Maintain, P Square were all heavily influenced by Hip-Hop - especially - and R&B. ADVERTISEMENT

I’m lucky Caitlin Clark didn’t hurt my neck.&nbsp;
Seriously. Every time I watch Clark, it seems, she hits a series of 3-point shots that make me—and it’s safe to presume, many other people—sharply tilt our head upwards, to look at the high heavens, wondering how she just did that. And I found myself putting extra pressure on those neck muscles and upper spine and all sorts of vulnerable body parts during Iowa’s 94-87 victory over LSU in their Elite Eight matchup of the NCAA tournament in Albany on Monday night.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How The Crown Shot Its Emotional Final Scenes With Imelda Staunton, Olivia Colman and Cl</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>

He was unforgettable, even when he struck out. His swing whirled him around until his slender legs were twisted beneath him. And the times when his big bat did connect were baseball’s biggest moments. The spell lasted until the Babe had trotted around the base paths, taking mincing steps on his small feet, tipping his cap to the mighty, reverent roar from the stands.
Sportwriters knocked themselves out thinking up new names and superlatives for him: The Sultan of Swat, the Bambino, The Colossus of Clout.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sheikh Gumi: Za a sako waanda aka sace a GSC Kagara nan ba da daewa ba</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>
