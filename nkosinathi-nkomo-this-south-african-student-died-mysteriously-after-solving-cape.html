But Nkomo’s father claimed that his son could never commit suicide because he had no debts, no enemies. In pain, he said that “the truth would come out one day”.</p><p>Conspiracy theorists have had a field day with many interpretations of the events leading up to his passing.</p><p>However, things took an unexpected turn when a tweet was posted congratulating a white inventor for an idea similar to Nkomo’s.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In the tweet, Helen Zille congratulated Retief Krige, an industrial designer who created Waterloo, a quick and easy way of using shower water to flush your loo.</p><p>Nkomo’s name has begun to trend after South Africans drew connections between Nkomo’s death, the gravity of Cape Town’s water problem and the emergence of this new inventor.</p><p>A life-ending idea?</p><p>As intimidating as it may seem to think what is being suggested is true, it would not be entirely absurd.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Many times, ideas have been stolen and their owners discarded so the value can pass to another.</p><p>Cape Town’s water crisis has made international news in recent weeks. The province is counting down to Day Zero. Despite careful rationing, the city’s water supply is fast running dry.</p><p>It is why Nkomo’s invention held many prospects and incited such support.</p><p>As it stands now, South Africa owes it to a young man, his family and supporters to find an answer to why he passed and what may have transpired regarding his invention.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02inqKhdmMKtwNSrnGimm6TAqrrArZ%2BiZZ6gvK67jK2foqtdqLy2wMdmmJ%2BqmZiur3nSraydnZ6peqW1xJ1kprGjqbKztc6uqqWxXZaztbHRZqqopKaeu6h5wpqnnmdpn8CzvpFv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./presentation-de-la-loi-3ds-compte-rendu.html><span>←</span><span>Prsentation de la loi 3DS (compte-rendu)</span></a>
