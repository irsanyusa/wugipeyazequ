At one point, he encouraged women to prioritize their “vocation” as mothers, wives, and homemakers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After clips of Butker’s speech went viral, the NFL responded to the outcry.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Harrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity,” Jonathan Beane, NFL senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer, said in a <a href=#>statement to ML Football</a>. “His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Butker suggested in his speech that working in the home is more valuable for women than professional accomplishments.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,” he said in his speech. “How many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m on this stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation,” he added.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He went on to criticize President Joe Biden for his support of abortion rights. He also mentioned a “deadly sin sort of pride that has a month dedicated to it,” an <a href=#>apparent reference to Pride month</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">People soon took to the internet to express their outrage over Butker’s speech.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Harrison Butker is a disgusting human being,” one person <a href=#>said on X.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“No, Harrison Butker didn’t praise women or promote family values with his sexist bigoted speech, he told women that serving a man like a Handmaid is all they should aspire to do in life, this whilst attacking LGBTQ+ people in the process,” another person <a href=#>said on X.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than 150,000 people signed a <a href=#>petition on Change.org</a> demanding the Kansas City Chiefs dismiss Butker for his comments.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We demand accountability from our sports figures who should be role models promoting respect for all people regardless of their race, gender identity or sexual orientation,” Willard Harris, who started the petition, said on the website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdufnd8jqGYq6qZqLyvecGuq6SdomK7p7iMpJinq5GoeqS0yJ6drGWTpLu1vs6vnKurqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cleanthony-early-knicks-basketball-player-shot-robbed-outside-strip-club.html><span>←</span><span>Knicks basketball player shot, robbed outside strip club</span></a>
