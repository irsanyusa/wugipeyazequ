For instance, two thirds of employers (66%) say it is not very serious or not at all serious is an employee is taking pens or pencils. Likewise 60% are not particularly bothered about notepads mysteriously disappearing.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Stealing20at20work20B2B-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Nevertheless, a hard core of 13-18% employers would take it very seriously if an employee was nicking some form of stationery, or indeed tea bags, toilet paper, homeware or food.</p><p>It is also no shock to see that employers are most concerned about the theft of money (which 89% would take very seriously) or computers/laptops (87%).</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><strong>See the full results for the workers sample <a href=#>here</a> and the business sample <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksqS7zaiksmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhqYWx9eXnWoZitZZGnsm6u0aKrqKajYsC1scCloKefXay8s7c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./night-agent-creator-shawn-ryan-star-gabriel-basso-season-1-1235561980.html><span>←</span><span>The Night Agent Star and Creator on the Personal Loss that Crafted the Story,Casting H</span></a>
