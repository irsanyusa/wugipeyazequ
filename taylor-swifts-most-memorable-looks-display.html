We hope this theatrical trail across the museum will inspire curious visitors to discover more about the performer, her creativity and V&A objects.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift is TIME’s Person of the Year</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The collection will explore 16 different looks worn by the pop-star, and items on display will include the customized cowboy boots she wore in 2007 when she first broke into the country music scene, and the black ruffled dress she wore in the music video for her new song Fortnight. The collection will also include musical instruments and other items on loan from Swift’s personal archive that will be on display for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The exhibit will only be available for a limited time, and will close on Sep. 8, 2024. Swift, 34, has spent much of the last month on tour across several locations in the U.K., including Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff, and London. She will continue to perform shows across Europe throughout the summer before returning to London again in late August, and subsequently touring in Canada.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlpf3SEjq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq6xlnaTAtXnMnqSoqpGXuaZ5y6impKtdmba0vMuasGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1581753-print-slip-police-give-fresh-update-recruitment.html><span>←</span><span>Print Your Slip: Kaduna Police Give Fresh Update on Recruitment</span></a>
