During her appearance at&nbsp;the Cannes Film Festival 2021, she stunned many of&nbsp;us with a&nbsp;look that embraces the passage of&nbsp;time and accepts her body with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;style. The echo it&nbsp;had in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a> gave cause to&nbsp;reflect on&nbsp;the beauty found in&nbsp;the changes associated with age.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>decided to&nbsp;tell you some details about the transition in&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;this actress, and we&nbsp;also thought to&nbsp;look for pictures of&nbsp;other beautiful famous women who look great with gray hair. You’ll find them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special bonus at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6c/c62/6e7ae6514e98df209ad28a321d.jpg><p>Actress and model <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Andie MacDowell</a> (<i>Four Weddings and a&nbsp;Funeral</i>, 1994) turned 64&nbsp;in&nbsp;April 2022. Her presence at&nbsp;the 74th annual Cannes Film Festival which took place from the 6th to&nbsp;the 17th of&nbsp;July 2021, surprised many because she decided to&nbsp;show off her natural gray hair, in&nbsp;her characteristic long, curly, and voluminous mane. On&nbsp;the second day of&nbsp;the event, she wore her hair in&nbsp;a&nbsp;low ponytail, also styled in&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;natural way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2a/cf6/88d3d65abcafcca450fd10674a.jpg><p>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;media attention was focused on&nbsp;Andie because until almost a&nbsp;year ago she had brown tones, and many praised and admired her decision to&nbsp;make the transition to&nbsp;natural gray. This was the perfect excuse to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;other great actresses who attended Cannes with gray, white, or&nbsp;graying hair in&nbsp;style, such as&nbsp;<a href=# title="Helen Mirren" data-link=tag>Helen Mirren</a> and Jodie Foster.</p><p>While the media can’t stop talking about her new look, we&nbsp;had noticed a&nbsp;little before the festival that she was committed to&nbsp;gray hair thanks to&nbsp;the pics she posted on&nbsp;her <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>. In&nbsp;the following post, which dates back to&nbsp;February 2021, she already talked about how she made the decision to&nbsp;stop dying her hair.</p><p>Back then, she saw her roots grow gray and asked people what they thought of&nbsp;it. Then she thought about doing what she felt most comfortable with: Accepting her natural hair color. “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ashamed of&nbsp;my&nbsp;age,” she wrote.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview she had with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Vogue</i></a><i> </i>magazine after Cannes, she commented that she follows Jack Martin, <a href=# title="Jane Fonda" data-link=tag>Jane Fonda</a>’s stylist, who had done a&nbsp;similar makeover to&nbsp;hers. With that in&nbsp;mind and many other examples of&nbsp;ordinary women she saw on&nbsp;Instagram, she was convinced to&nbsp;go&nbsp;natural.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a7/afe/cd772d5a20b4cee1cefbae5f65.jpg><p>In&nbsp;that same <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, MacDowell offered other quotes that we&nbsp;think may be&nbsp;inspirational for women who, like her, are thinking about giving their hair a&nbsp;break from dye to&nbsp;show off their gray hair:</p><ul><li>“I’ve never felt more powerful. I&nbsp;feel more honest. I&nbsp;feel like I’m not pretending.”<br></li><li>“I&nbsp;look younger because it&nbsp;looks more natural.”</li></ul><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;industry like <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, Andie says that, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, she has always suffered from age discrimination, and she assures&nbsp;us that mature men are not put through the same kind of&nbsp;pressure. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation she would like to&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;on. But she clarifies that she does not judge others nor does she want everyone to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same thing as&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>Bonus: 10&nbsp;celebrities who look great with white and gray hair</h2></p><p>From Judi Dench, 86, to&nbsp;Queen Letizia, 48, here are some celebrities who wear their gray hair in&nbsp;style.</p><p><h2>1. Judi Dench&nbsp;— 87&nbsp;years old</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Judi Dench</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the actresses who has long worn her hair as&nbsp;naturally as&nbsp;possible, in&nbsp;keeping with her age. In&nbsp;June 2020, her tone was highlighted on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;the June issue of&nbsp;<i>British </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Vogue</i></a>. It&nbsp;was the first time Judi had appeared on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;that magazine and, at&nbsp;85, she became the oldest person to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p><p><h2>2. Jane Fonda&nbsp;— 84&nbsp;years old</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be9/356/5c8b405c4c9f2401f4593f2330.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Grace and Frankie</i></a><i> </i>(May&nbsp;8, 2015&nbsp;— April&nbsp;29, 2022) wore her hair blonde in&nbsp;recent years until she surprised many during the 2020 Oscar ceremony with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>silver hair</a>. About a&nbsp;year later, she received the Cecil B. DeMille Award on&nbsp;stage at&nbsp;the 2021 Golden Globes and stayed true to&nbsp;her gray hair. The Hollywood legend once shared her wisdom on&nbsp;aging in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview,</a> “You know, you can be&nbsp;really old at&nbsp;60, and you can be&nbsp;really young at&nbsp;85. Health!”</p><p><h2>3. Helen Mirren&nbsp;— 76&nbsp;years</h2></p><p>Oscar winner Helen Mirren is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the actresses who teamed up&nbsp;with the white or&nbsp;gray hair trend, along with Andie MacDowell, at&nbsp;the Cannes Film Festival. And we&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;contrasted beautifully with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>yellow</a> Dolce &&nbsp;Gabbana dress she wore to&nbsp;the event.</p><p><h2>4. Diane Keaton&nbsp;— 76&nbsp;years old</h2></p><p>Diane Keaton is&nbsp;an&nbsp;icon of&nbsp;style. She’s known for wearing masculine, black garments, hats and her medium-length gray hair. In&nbsp;2014 she also drew attention at&nbsp;an&nbsp;awards show, this time it&nbsp;was at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Golden Globes</a>, when she showed her gray hair in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the audience after a&nbsp;long stint with blonde tones.</p><p><h2>5. Glenn Close&nbsp;— 75&nbsp;years old</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b8/ed4/f4b8b958a8827956d328fe6c56.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Glenn Close</a>, who was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;2021 for her performance in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hillbilly Elegy</i></a> (2020), is&nbsp;another actress who has been sporting white hair and making it&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her style for some time now; she usually wears it&nbsp;short and with trendy bangs.</p><p><h2>6. Caroline, Princess of&nbsp;Hanover&nbsp;— 65&nbsp;years old</h2></p><p>Princess Caroline is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman known for being very elegant, and her look variations have always caught the attention of&nbsp;the media. Now most people look with great approval at&nbsp;how she has decided to&nbsp;show off her natural gray hair and keep her midi cut. This change started recently, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;last year.</p><p><h2>7. Jamie Lee Curtis&nbsp;— 63&nbsp;years old</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9b/184/24ffbd56bb884c711b99a9094d.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> is&nbsp;from Andie MacDowell’s generation too, but she has been wearing her hair in&nbsp;different shades of&nbsp;gray for much longer. At&nbsp;the 2019 Golden Globes, she decided to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;whiter and brighter shade, and it&nbsp;also gave folks a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;talk about. The actress had opened up&nbsp;about her decision, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> ’’Why do&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;look 17&nbsp;when you’re 70? I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;look 70&nbsp;when I’m 70."</p><p><h2>8. Jodie Foster&nbsp;— 59&nbsp;years old</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0c/bdd/8613435eb0b76ee26b9ca94a52.jpg><p>After <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>winning</a> a&nbsp;Golden Globe in&nbsp;February 2021 (The Mauritanian) and receiving it&nbsp;in&nbsp;her pajamas, she was also in&nbsp;the media spotlight during this year’s Cannes Film Festival, when she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> with strands of&nbsp;natural gray hair framing her face. At&nbsp;this event, the actress and director was awarded an&nbsp;honorary Palme d’Or for her career in&nbsp;the film industry.</p><p><h2>9. Salma Hayek&nbsp;— 55&nbsp;years old</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Salma Hayek</a> still allows herself to&nbsp;play with the colors she covers her mane with, but she’s one of&nbsp;the actresses we&nbsp;follow on&nbsp;Instagram who occasionally lets&nbsp;us know how proud she is&nbsp;of&nbsp;her incipient gray hair.</p><p><h2>10. Queen Letizia of&nbsp;Spain&nbsp;— 49&nbsp;years old</h2></p><p>Queen Letizia, who is&nbsp;known for always maintaining an&nbsp;impeccable image, is&nbsp;just one of&nbsp;the many royals who shows off her few natural gray hairs at&nbsp;public events.</p><p>We&nbsp;like to&nbsp;know that people feel good about the hair color they choose to&nbsp;wear, with or&nbsp;without hair color. What is&nbsp;your current hair color? Have you ever imagined yourself with gray or&nbsp;silver hair?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in June 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6vsMieZKaZk5m8uLHLpWSappRifnF5zq2fnqpdmLKtscGroK2hlah6tbTArWSwnZ6peqK4y2amrqxdqbxuvNGorZ5ll6euunnHmqCrZZmoeqOxwK6rop6loXp5fJJsZ25n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./un-rapport-du-senat-pointe-le-surgel-des-credits-du-secteur-medicosocial.html><span>←</span><span>Un rapport du Snat pointe le &amp;quot;surgel&amp;quot; des crdits du secteur mdicosocial</span></a>
