<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>13 Time-Saving Computer Life Hacks We Wish We Had Learned Sooner</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There are 3&nbsp;types of&nbsp;computer users: the ones who use their <a href=# title=mouse data-link=tag>mouse</a>, those who use their <a href=# title=keyboard data-link=tag>keyboard</a>, and those who prefer talking to&nbsp;Cortana or&nbsp;Siri. No&nbsp;matter which category you fall into, you can’t deny the immense usefulness of&nbsp;certain shortcuts and hacks that reveal the unknown possibilities your computer always had. These smart tricks improve your everyday computer experience and give an&nbsp;absolute boost in&nbsp;your productivity and in&nbsp;your security.</p><p>Here at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side</strong>,<strong> </strong>we&nbsp;collected 13&nbsp;computer hacks that will be&nbsp;massively helpful to&nbsp;anyone using their computer for fun or&nbsp;business.</p><p><h2>1. Ctrl + T&nbsp;opens a&nbsp;new tab</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5e/a75/15ff965440bbbeebf94a288df6.jpg><p>When you work a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;your&nbsp;PC and your web browser is&nbsp;your number one tool, opening new tabs is&nbsp;an&nbsp;action that you do&nbsp;countless times during the day. Instead of&nbsp;doing it&nbsp;manually with your mouse, <strong>you can simply press “ctrl” and the letter&nbsp;T, and a&nbsp;new tab will open. </strong>If&nbsp;you are using a&nbsp;MacBook, you can press “command” instead of&nbsp;“ctrl.”</p><p>If&nbsp;you are using <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Microsoft</a> Excel on&nbsp;your computer, pressing these buttons opens up&nbsp;the Create Table dialog box. In&nbsp;PowerPoint, you can use Ctrl+T to&nbsp;open the Format Text box, which helps you with the style&nbsp;— font size and type. In&nbsp;<a href=# title=Photoshop data-link=tag>Photoshop</a>, this can help you choose an&nbsp;element with the Move Tool, and can adjust the size and rotate your selection.</p><p><h2>2. Ask Google about any problem you’re facing before going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;PC expert.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b95/d48/9887b055ca95414cf41bd68f60.jpg><p>Most IT&nbsp;problems are simple issues that can easily be&nbsp;resolved by&nbsp;following a&nbsp;few steps. However, most people panic when anything wrong happens and run to&nbsp;the nearest&nbsp;PC expert. Just remember to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cool and slow down. <strong>You can type your problem into the Google search bar and read what Microsoft or&nbsp;the various tech forums have to&nbsp;tell you.</strong> You will probably find the solution there and won’t need to&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;an&nbsp;expert.</p><p><h2>3. For currency conversions, use the Google search bar instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;calculator.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e81/697/03d04f52f0bca80b2bc79c8ac4.png><p>Who needs calculators when you have something as&nbsp;precious as&nbsp;Google? If&nbsp;you’re traveling abroad and you need to&nbsp;see how much money you will get with the exchange, you can simply search using the phrase that includes the amount of&nbsp;money and the currencies of&nbsp;the country where you’re traveling. <strong>A&nbsp;simple “100 dollars to&nbsp;euros” will be&nbsp;enough</strong> to&nbsp;learn how much you’ll win or&nbsp;lose from the exchange.</p><p>If&nbsp;you want a&nbsp;quick and simple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calculator</a>, you can also use Google. Plus, you can use it&nbsp;on&nbsp;both Windows and Mac. For example, you can type 36+72-51&nbsp;on the search bar and click enter to&nbsp;get your answer. It’s one of&nbsp;the best tricks you can use to&nbsp;get your answers faster. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also very easy to&nbsp;use Google as&nbsp;a&nbsp;converter. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t have to&nbsp;have anything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with currencies&nbsp;— you could be&nbsp;looking for lengths. All you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;simply type 20.2&nbsp;cm in&nbsp;inches into the Google search bar to&nbsp;get your result.</p><p><h2>4. A&nbsp;laptop battery charges faster when in&nbsp;airplane mode.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a58/339/e813d853879b629c2dca6da59b.jpg><p>When your laptop is&nbsp;on&nbsp;airplane mode it&nbsp;means that many features, like your Wi-Fi and <a href=# title=Bluetooth data-link=tag>Bluetooth</a>, are disabled. This takes some pressure off your battery and allows it&nbsp;to&nbsp;charge faster than if&nbsp;you were operating it&nbsp;normally. <strong>Expect to&nbsp;see your laptop fully charged 10-15 minutes faster than if&nbsp;you had airplane mode turned off.</strong></p><p>When your phone is&nbsp;on&nbsp;airplane mode, it&nbsp;isn’t connected to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tower the whole time, and it&nbsp;doesn’t search for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and your<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> Location. </a>It&nbsp;also doesn’t let the apps on&nbsp;your phone communicate constantly with servers. This mode is&nbsp;best to&nbsp;use for other hacks too. You can check your messages on&nbsp;Facebook or&nbsp;Viber without leaving people on&nbsp;“read” or&nbsp;showing them “seen” receipts, so&nbsp;they won’t know whether you saw their message or&nbsp;not. It’s also a&nbsp;good hack to&nbsp;use when you want to&nbsp;screenshot something. For example, if&nbsp;someone sent you an&nbsp;image on&nbsp;Instagram or&nbsp;Snapchat, it&nbsp;won’t let them know that you took a&nbsp;screenshot even if&nbsp;you did. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;your mental well-being, it’s always good to&nbsp;disconnect from your device for a&nbsp;while. You can use airplane mode as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hack to&nbsp;disconnect your mind from <a href=# title=technology data-link=tag>technology</a>, and you won’t be&nbsp;bombarded with emails, texts, or&nbsp;calls.</p><p><h2>5. Download any Google image automatically by&nbsp;pressing Alt and clicking on&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e0/508/4990725f499acfc17965a97f57.jpg><p>Most people right-click on&nbsp;images and select the “save” option, but there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;much easier and faster way to&nbsp;download a&nbsp;photo on&nbsp;your computer. You can simply push “alt” and then left-click on&nbsp;an&nbsp;image and <strong>it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;automatically saved on&nbsp;your computer in&nbsp;your Downloads folder. </strong>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;MacBook, when you press control and then click on&nbsp;the image, it&nbsp;will then give you a&nbsp;drop-down menu where you can select Copy Image.</p><p><h2>6. Hide your&nbsp;IP address so&nbsp;that nobody sees what you’re doing.</h2></p><p>Your IP&nbsp;address is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>identifier</a> that tells websites who you are online. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;would make sense that you don’t want your personal information out there. You can do&nbsp;this by&nbsp;installing VPN. Not only are VPNs used for hiding your info, but they can also be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;access websites that you normally wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;access.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are at&nbsp;work, and one of&nbsp;your tasks was to&nbsp;connect to&nbsp;a&nbsp;company’s network, you might need a&nbsp;bit more info on&nbsp;them, so&nbsp;you may want to&nbsp;install VPN software. Sometimes, your&nbsp;IT department may give you a&nbsp;password&nbsp;— with&nbsp;it, you can then set this up&nbsp;by&nbsp;yourself. You can also use this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cool trick you can do&nbsp;with your computer.</p><p>There are various ways to&nbsp;hide your&nbsp;IP address and make your browsing invisible. First of&nbsp;all, <strong>you need to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;good VPN on&nbsp;your internet browser</strong> so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;changes your real location.</p><p><h2>7. A&nbsp;clean desktop means a&nbsp;faster computer.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you are having problems with your computer’s speed, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;the fact that your desktop is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;icons. Instead of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;folder for every little thing on&nbsp;your desktop, <strong>you can create one folder and organize everything in&nbsp;there</strong>. Next, put all of&nbsp;your apps in&nbsp;the task bar and you will be&nbsp;left will an&nbsp;almost empty desktop. This action will instantly maximize your computer’s speed.</p><p>There are other ways you can make your computer work faster if&nbsp;your desktop is&nbsp;already clean. You can restart your computer, download a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>device</a> optimization program, remove unused apps and software, delete large files and old files, empty your recycle bin, and change your PC’s power setting.</p><p><h2>8. Find out who’s stealing your Wi-Fi.</h2></p><p>Isn’t it&nbsp;annoying when your connection is&nbsp;slow because someone else is&nbsp;taking advantage of&nbsp;your Wi-Fi? In&nbsp;this case, you will probably need to&nbsp;change your Wi-Fi password and make sure that no&nbsp;one can get access to&nbsp;your network again. You can also check to&nbsp;see who’s been stealing an&nbsp;internet connection from you and confront them about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Most of&nbsp;us have 4G&nbsp;and 5G&nbsp;connections on&nbsp;our phones, but when we&nbsp;are at&nbsp;home, in&nbsp;coffee shops, at&nbsp;libraries, and in&nbsp;airports, we&nbsp;usually connect to&nbsp;Wi-Fi. When we&nbsp;are at&nbsp;home, we&nbsp;like to&nbsp;keep our Wi-Fi to&nbsp;ourselves, and someone hacking you is&nbsp;never a&nbsp;good sign. Sometimes, when people have access to&nbsp;our Wi-Fi, they can even steal our information off of&nbsp;our laptops and give our devices viruses.</p><p><h2>9. You can recover deleted files, even if&nbsp;you’ve emptied the recycle bin.</h2></p><p>Deleting files and then emptying the recycling bin can prove to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very frustrating since you may only realize afterward that in&nbsp;that pile was a&nbsp;file that you really needed. <strong>What you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;recover your deleted files</strong>. You just choose what type of&nbsp;file you’re looking for and the program you’re using searches everything for you. But if&nbsp;it’s been a&nbsp;long time since you deleted a&nbsp;file, it’s possible that the program won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;locate&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>10. If&nbsp;you notice these signs, your computer has been hacked.</h2></p><p>While we’re often told millions of&nbsp;people get hacked every day, this simply is&nbsp;not factual. A&nbsp;closer number would be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2,200</a>. According to&nbsp;Norton, “There isn’t concise data on&nbsp;how many people get hacked a&nbsp;year. However, considering there are around <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>2,200 cyberattacks per day</strong></a>, that could equate to&nbsp;more than 800,000 people being hacked per year.”</p><p><h2>11. Windows + C&nbsp;enables you to&nbsp;start talking to&nbsp;Cortana.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eda/b0d/69cd3e5b2aacc43910a42e320f.jpg><p>For users who have bought Microsoft laptops or&nbsp;use PCs with the latest windows 10&nbsp;version, Cortana is&nbsp;the digital person that can guide you through anything you need. If&nbsp;you don’t know how to&nbsp;perform a&nbsp;certain action or&nbsp;are bored of&nbsp;using the mouse, <strong>you can press “windows” and the letter&nbsp;C and ask Cortana anything you want.</strong> She will ask you questions in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;guide you to&nbsp;the action you need to&nbsp;perform. If&nbsp;on&nbsp;the other hand you’re using a&nbsp;MacBook, you will need to&nbsp;press “command” and then the space bar in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;start talking to&nbsp;Siri.</p><p><h2>12. Ctrl + Q&nbsp;quits your web browser.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d4/172/9bbfa75e3782e30fed6e8c81fb.jpg><p>Another tremendously useful shortcut is&nbsp;the one that helps you exit your web browser. In&nbsp;this case, <strong>you press “ctrl” and then the letter&nbsp;Q</strong> and<strong> </strong>if&nbsp;you are using a&nbsp;MacBook you use the “command” button instead of&nbsp;the “ctrl” button. This way everything happens a&nbsp;bit faster.</p><p>When used in&nbsp;Microsoft Word, these buttons are used to&nbsp;remove the paragraph’s format. In&nbsp;Outlook, this marks a&nbsp;selected e-mail as&nbsp;read.</p><p><h2>13. Ctrl + I&nbsp;turns the text style into italics.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac9/417/c6760e515e9e4ea8dd863ef16d.jpg><p>When combining the “ctrl” key and the letter&nbsp;I there are various things that can happen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>412</a> different programs. However, the most ordinary and common use of&nbsp;the combo is<strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;turn text in&nbsp;Word and other text editing programs from normal style into italics</strong>. All you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;highlight the word or&nbsp;words you want and press the 2&nbsp;keys. For Mac users, you should press the command key and then the letter&nbsp;I in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;perform the same action.</p><p>How useful were the above keyboard hacks and how much time will they save you in&nbsp;your daily routine?
