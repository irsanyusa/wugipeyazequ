Increased interest or focus on sex</h3></p><p>Sometimes, a man who hasn't been sexually active might exhibit a heightened awareness or interest in sexual topics. This could manifest as frequent sexual comments or jokes, a greater interest in watching pornography or initiating conversations about sex more often.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>2. Awkwardness or insecurity</h3></p><p>If a man hasn't been sexually active for a while, he might feel a bit rusty or anxious about initiating sex or responding to your advances. This could lead to fumbling, awkwardness, or even performance anxiety during intimacy.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ba375b43-5bc9-49b7-9f9f-d442b7e22148 data-caption="Signs of sexual inactivity in men [Healthshots]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Xl5ktkpTURBXy9mMDIwMWIyNThjYzNkYTFjNDIzY2EyNzcxMzMzNDAzMS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAb3Cww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>3. Lower stamina or endurance</h3></p><p>Regular sexual activity can improve physical stamina and endurance. If a man hasn't been sexually active for a while, he might experience lower stamina or fatigue during intimacy. This is completely normal and shouldn't be a cause for concern.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>4. Changes in emotional state</h3></p><p>Just like physical intimacy can impact mood, a lack of sexual activity might also influence a man's emotional state. He might seem more irritable, withdrawn, or less affectionate. This might translate to a decrease in initiating non-sexual forms of physical affection, like cuddling or holding hands.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>5. Increased focus on other physical activities</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Sometimes, a man who hasn't been sexually active might channel his energy into other forms of physical activity like working out more frequently or focusing on hobbies that require physical exertion.</p><p><strong>N.B: these signs can be subjective and might have other explanations.</strong></p><p>If you're curious about your partner's sexual history or desires, the best course of action is open and honest communication. Here are some tips for approaching the conversation:</p><ul class=list><li>Choose a calm and private setting.</li><li>Focus on "I" statements ("I've noticed you seem a little less interested in physical touch lately") rather than accusatory statements.</li><li>Express your own desires and needs in a loving way.</li><li>Listen attentively to your partner's perspective without judgment.</li></ul><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Whether your partner has been sexually active recently or not, the most important thing is to nurture a strong emotional connection. Here are some <a href=# id=57eadd01-56d5-4790-92cb-3c32df4a52f1>ways to keep the spark alive</a>:</p><ul class=list><li>Plan quality time together.
