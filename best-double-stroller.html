<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Best Double Strollers, Tested and Reviewed</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Whether you’ve decided to expand your family or you’re surprised with twins at your ultrasound appointment, a double stroller allows you to continue to move, groove and get through that to-do list with ease.</p><p>Double strollers have come a long way, and now come in different combinations, shapes, sizes, weight limits, and configurations to handle all of your needs. There are traditional strollers, wagons, and trailers. And some come with dual seats while others work as a base that car seats, bassinets, and toddler seats can click into.</p><p>With so many double strollers on the market, it can get overwhelming. And many parents feel puzzled by the purchasing process since it’s usually a significant financial investment. Luckily, I enlisted a panel of parent testers to give the top-rated double strollers a whirl and report back on their experience.</p><h2 id=our-top-and-tested-picks-for-best-double-strollers>Our top (and tested) picks for best double strollers</h2><h3>Best convertible double stroller: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mockingbird Single-to-Double 2.0</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best convertible double stroller</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Mockingbird Single-to-Double 2.0</h3></p><p>As your family grows, you need more options. One of the top-rated (and award-winning) double strollers comes from Mockingbird. It’s expandable and lets parents choose how they want to configure the set-up. You can add another seat, a bassinet, and even turn the double stroller into a triple with a riding board. There’s plenty of bells, whistles and meaningful features, and my tester Kerry was excited to dig right in.</p><p>From the moment the double stroller arrived, it made a good first impression on Kerry. The packaging was fun and clever, and while it came in five boxes, everything was well-labeled and easy to navigate. Kerry said lugging around many boxes may be a pain, but It helped her to set expectations on what was inside each box and what order to open everything in. Inside, the user guide and warranty info were all neatly bundled into an envelope with a convenient QR code that you could scan for assembly instructions. The QR code directed to a video on their site that Kerry didn’t find helpful, but the user manual was excellent.</p><p>After a quick set-up process, it was time to take it for a stroll. Kerry and her husband took this stroller on a few different cruises through their urban neighborhood. The stroller fared amazingly strolling through the park and even over bumpy/uneven sidewalks and gravel. Overall, it seemed like a really smooth ride, and her child was very comfy in her seat. “I did notice that her legs seemed a little long for the seat already, and with the medal edging around the leg portion of the seat, she had her legs bent or folded most of the ride,” she says. “This probably isn't a huge deal, but for taller kiddos or maybe a little older, I could see this being a hindrance.”</p><p>Kerry shared that adding the infant padding to the second seat felt so soft and pillowy. “Adding the second seat was pretty simple. I watched a YouTube video to ensure I was installing it correctly, and it only took a few minutes to set up,” she continued. “Walking with the double seat was a little bit of an adjustment for me, but overall, it still had such a smooth feel when turning, walking faster, and with overall use.”</p><p>Kerry did notice a downside with both the single and double seat configuration. Typically, when she’s hopping onto a curb or going downstairs with her other strollers, she likes to tilt the handlebar back and essentially pop a wheelie, so she’s riding on just the larger back tires to navigate the bumps. “This stroller felt really heavy when I'd push down on the bars to try and lift the front. It was doable, but it felt like I had to give it some force to get over those hurdles,” she added.</p><p>To describe the storage basket underneath, Kerry used one word: amazing! It holds everything you need—from baby essentials to toddler snacks, jackets, and more. When shopping for a double stroller, it’s important to understand just how much space it’ll take up, and for the Mockingbird, it’s a lot. “If you're tight on storage space, it might make more sense to use the infant insert vs. the car seat adapter,” she recommended.</p><p>“The all-black with leather accents were so sleek and luxurious looking,” Kerry said about the design. “It felt very high-end to me.”</p><p>Kerry said the thoughtful details were key: the storage possibilities and even the cupholder and personal caddy attachment are such nice touches—far better than any other stroller caddy. “It might seem like such a small detail, but when you're trying to get out the door with multiple kiddos, snacks, water bottles, phone and headphones so you can listen to a podcast, and then you realize you have no good place to store them on your walk. It’s not fun.” she says. “This was a game-changer.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 27 pounds, 35 pounds with two seats</li><li>Folded size: 34 x 25.5 x 18 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 50 pounds for the single stroller seat, 45 pounds for each toddler seat if using them together</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes</li><li>Cleaning: Machine washable</li><li>Child age/weight range: From 6 months up to 50 pounds (or 42”) for the single stroller seat, or up to 45 pounds in each toddler seat if using them together.

The single stroller, seat, and accessories came neatly packaged in one box, and the second seat attachment and bassinet came in their own separate boxes. They all arrived together and in good condition. Madison said an instruction booklet was included in all packages pertaining to each part, all with a video code. This was helpful since the manual had no words, only images. After watching the videos, it took her about 20 minutes to unpack, assemble, and learn how to configure the seats the way she wanted.</p><p>To test it, she configured two forward-facing toddler seats and was happily surprised the stroller still felt lightweight and had a smooth ride. “I took it on the greenway near our house, with some gravel paths along the way, and the ride seemed comfortable for the kids and didn’t bother me, even though I was heavily pregnant,” she added.</p><p>Another big benefit is the ample storage at the bottom. Madison loved that it came with an additional “shopping” bag if you only use the stroller with one child. It also came with a rain cover, which she has not had to use yet but is grateful to have just in case. In terms of folding and stowing, Madison says this stroller folds nicely with both seats attached and isn’t too precarious to load into the back of her Prius; it takes up about the same amount of space as her previous travel system for her infant car seat.</p><p>Madison’s overall impression of this stroller is that it is great for growing families and usage on different types of terrain.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 28.4 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 32.9 x 25.4 x 12.2 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 50 pounds for the single stroller seat, and 50 pounds each when used in duo (double) mode</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes</li><li>Cleaning: Machine washable</li><li>Child age/weight range: From six months to 50 pounds.

UPPAbaby has a fantastic reputation and is considered one of the gear category leaders, and their Vista was designed for growing families. It starts as a single stroller but can quickly transform to accommodate up to three children with added accessories and adapters, from a second toddler seat to a bassinet, and more.</p><p>Our tester, Rebecca, was amazed by how many parts came in such small packaging without excess, unneeded packaging. Everything arrived with no damage, and the stroller pieces easily snapped together. While there were instructions, Rebecca said she almost didn’t need them because it was so obvious how to place it all together for the single stroller. However, she did have to use the manual to figure out how to disassemble the single stroller to make it into a double stroller. “This was much less obvious, but the instructions did list the steps with lots of details,” she shares. “Putting together the single stroller took less than 10 minutes to unbox and assemble. Then it took another 20 minutes to figure out the double stroller attachment.”</p><p>She took the Vista 2 out for a walk in her neighborhood with her two-year old toddler and five-month old baby. And even with the added weight, the ride was still very smooth. She said the wheels are a great size, so they roll over rocky pathways just as well as glide along a sidewalk. “I'm very impressed with how light the stroller is,” she shared. “It's very easy to carry up and down stairs and to lift in and out of cars. I've used much heavier car seats before, and in comparison, easily lifting this one out of the car and attaching it straight onto the stroller was a breeze”</p><p>Rebecca shares that while this is not a small stroller, it does come apart and fold to be surprisingly compact for storage for how large it is. “There are lots of options for attachments, including the bassinet, the car seat, and the two seats (Toddler & Rumble.) This is useful, but it does mean that you need to store a lot of parts,” she adds.</p><p>“I like that it is a stacked double instead of a side-by-side because it makes it much easier to navigate sidewalks and store isles,” she says. “I would have liked if you could use the bassinet with the regular seat for a very small baby with a toddler, but that is just too much to fit onto one stroller.”</p><p>Rebecca’s overall impression is that this is a very nice stroller and an excellent option for a double stroller. It can be a great investment for parents starting off with one child and knowing they will need a double stroller in the future.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 27 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 17.3 x 25. x 33.3 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 3 months to 50 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Compatible with the UPPAbaby Mesa infant car seat without the need for adapters.</li><li>Cleaning: Hand clean</li><li>Child age/weight range: Bassinet suitable from birth up to 20 pounds or until infant can push up on hands and knees, whichever comes first; Toddler Seat suitable from 3 months to 50 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 36 x 25.7 x 39.5 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $999.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Easy assembly</li><li>Smooth</li><li>Lightweight</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Storing all of the attachments takes up a lot of space</li><li>Expensive</li><li>Second seat and additional attachments are sold separately</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A good investment option for growing families — with added attachments, it can be configured to support three children at once</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>UPPAbaby Vista V2</a></p><h3>Best multipurpose stroller: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nuna Demi next + pipa urbn travel system</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best multipurpose stroller</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Nuna Demi next + pipa urbn travel system</h3></p><p>Another cult-followed gear brand that earns top awards and reviews is the Nuna travel system. Their Demi next and Pipa Travel System model is designed for a modern family who values options, flexibility, and ease of travel. It has 25+ configuration options, from a single stroller to a double. There’s a rider board, a sibling seat, a bassinet, and a car seat attachment—you dream it, they have it. Our tester, Rachel, was up for the challenge with her 2.5-year-old daughter and 7-month-old son.</p><p>Since she was sent the full travel system, there were a lot of parts. And thus, figuring out whether they went to the car seat or the stroller took a few minutes—and a lot of navigating the question of ‘What is this?’</p><p>Even so, Rachel said everything was really well packaged, protected, and easy to unwrap. The box was very heavy (again...it included the whole Pipa Travel System, not just the stroller), but it had handles on the side, which was a nice touch and made it slightly easier to haul inside the house.</p><p>Rachel shared that the booklet has well-drawn illustrations paired with step-by-step instructions, including a couple of pages of multiple configurations for the double seat so that once you got it all set up initially, you also knew all the ways to configure the seats! All in, Rachel said it probably took her and her husband the better part of 30 to 45 minutes to set up and figure out.</p><p>They were ready to hit the road once everything was loaded in the stroller. Right away, they noticed how smooth the ride was, especially on pavement. “It felt light to push, even with two kids. It did well on uphills, and the brake is really strong on the downhills,” she shared. I was afraid it would feel bulky with the double set-up, but it didn't.”</p><p>Rachel shared that taking corners with the double setup required a wider turn, but with one seat, it was nice and sharp. The suspension is pretty good, though definitely a little more bumpy on dirt or grass. Her favorite feature was how seamless it is to swap seats and configurations: “We could do the car seat on top, toddler seat on bottom, toddler seat on top, facing us, facing away, and more,” she shared. “It's so easy to switch, even while you're on the move.”</p><p>Surprisingly, for a double stroller, Rachel said it doesn’t take up much space, even when it's opened up. While it fits two kids easily, it isn’t wide, like many double strollers. It packs up and folds, but it takes two hands (buttons on either side of the handlebar need to be pushed in and then pulled up). The pulling up portion of this process got stuck pretty often at first and then got stuck again towards the end of the fold, meaning it wouldn't latch/lock closed without yet another attempt at the push-and-pull. “It took us two to three tries on each fold attempt to get it to close, even after practicing a few times, but we got a little faster with it by the second day,” she added.</p><p>Rachel noted that once the toddler seat folds, it’s not convenient to carry or lift if you leave the toddler seat in/attached to the stroller. “The calf support for the toddler seat won't collapse all the way, meaning the carry bar access is mostly blocked, and even if you do manage to get ahold of it, carrying it that way is awkward and heavy,” she explained. “However, if there is no seat in the stroller, it is quite easy to close and light to carry.”</p><p>While there wasn’t a storage bag included, there were tons of accessories that Rachel liked: the bug net built-in to the canopy, rain cover, arm bar, two different kinds of car seat adapters, and more. From a style perspective, Rachel says the black with the leather-looking handles feels very chic, and the basket is deep enough for the storage you need, and even the underside of the canopy looks plush and pretty. “I sent the photos to a friend, and she called it the Rolls Royce of strollers — and I honestly agree,” she added.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 26 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 23.5 x 24 x 35 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 50 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes</li><li>Cleaning: Hand clean</li><li>Child age/weight range: Birth to 50 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 39.5 x 24 x 43.5 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $1.350</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Easy to switch configurations</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Comprehensive instructions</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Bumpier on dirt or grass</li><li>Two hands needed for folding</li><li>Tough to lift/carry stroller w/ toddler seat attached</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>With 25+ modes, this is the definition of a multipurpose stroller, and switching between configurations is a breeze.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nuna Demi next + pipa urbn travel system</a></p><h3>Best double wagon stroller: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Safety 1ˢᵗ® Summit Wagon Stroller</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best double wagon stroller</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.safety1st.com/media/catalog/product/cache/cac8d5d16b38084dc4e42c86a74d6730/v/d/vdbgsr4jr7jw8fygrrbh_sif5girtusbngd6p.png alt="Safety 1ˢᵗ® Summit Wagon Stroller" title="Safety 1ˢᵗ® Summit Wagon Stroller" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Safety 1ˢᵗ® Summit Wagon Stroller</h3></p><p>While some families like a double stroller design, others prefer a wagon approach. This best-seller from Safety 1st is not only affordable but also comes with two comfortable memory foam seats, a 50+ SPF canopy, and heavy-duty wheels that can manage any terrain. Packed with storage and configuration options, you can click in an infant car seat and let big brother or sister sit beside their sibling. When you aren’t out on an adventure, it folds up to be self-standing.</p><p>Our tester, Claire, was excited to put this wagon to the test with her 2-year-old and 3-month-old. The double stroller arrived safely and the packaging was clean, easy to unpack, and in great condition. After opening the box, Claire said the instructions were straightforward, and perhaps the easier piece of baby gear she and her husband have put together. Each part felt solid and sturdy, and the entire process took less than 15 minutes. “The best part is most were large pieces that just clipped together. There weren't a lot of little nuts and bolts to configure,” she added.</p><p>Once set up, Claire took the stroller on a sanded path, on the sidewalk, and even over some wooded areas, and her toddler remained comfortable. Other than having to put some extra strength into the tougher terrain areas, the stroller continued to glide through every type of surface on which they tested it. According to Claire, another benefit of this wagon is the adjustable handlebar. When parents are at different heights, this is great so everyone can be comfortable taking the kids on a walk. Claire also liked the two folding UV screens that provide total shade. The wagon also comes with a basket and parent pouch for additional storage. She says it was big enough to carry home groceries, toddler snacks, and other necessities. Claire says there isn’t a cup holder option for parents, which would be a helpful addition.</p><p>Folding it up proved to be pretty tricky, though, said Rachel. “Reaching the button that starts the fold is uncomfortable since it’s lower down and difficult to grasp. While pushing on this button, you have to fold the side simultaneously, which is tricky for one person (who is keeping an eye on a toddler, too). To pack it up neatly enough to put it in the car, the wheels require some finagling.” Once folded, it did easily fit in most trunks of a car for transportation for such a roomy wagon.</p><p>Even with this folding challenge, the wagon had its upsides. Claire says it looks high-quality for the cost and has a sleek but durable appearance and awesome functionality. “My two-year-old son has never loved a typical stroller and the wagon format makes him so happy,” she says. “Also, there is plenty of storage for parents to keep snacks, wipes, and toys. It rides smoothly and has an awesome tray insert for your child to have a snack while on the go comfortably. For the price tag it offers so much.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 32.82 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 19.3 x 26.8 x 29.5 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 120 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes</li><li>Cleaning: Removable, dishwasher-safe child tray with 2 cup holders.</li><li>Child age/weight range: Fits 2 kids up to 55 pounds each; Holds an additional 10 pounds of storage for a maximum weight of 120 pounds</li><li>Dimensions: 42.7 x 26.8 x 52.4 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $299.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Large canopies</li><li>Roomy storage basket</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Difficult to fold</li><li>No carrying handle</li><li>Can be challenging to get over curb</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An excellent alternative to the traditional double stroller, this wagon stroller option offers roomy seating, great sun coverage, and ample storage.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Safety 1ˢᵗ® Summit Wagon Stroller</a></p><h3>Best for outdoor adventures: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Thule Chariot Cross Multisport Trailer & Stroller</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jogging Kit</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best for outdoor adventures</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Thule Chariot Cross Multisport Trailer & Stroller</h3></p><p><h3 class=title>Thule Chariot Double Jog Kit</h3></p><p>My Danish husband grew up in Copenhagen until he moved to Boston for graduate school. While we call the United States home (for now), we make Danish culture a big part of our everyday life. So when we had the chance to test the Thule Chariot Cross Multisport Trailer & Stroller, I’m not sure who was most excited: me, my husband, or our toddler. Since we want a second child, we opted for the double trailer to give our family room to grow. It’s designed for active families and attaches to the back of nearly any bicycle via a wide selection of attachments. It’s flexible and comfortable.</p><p>We found it well-designed, and the instructions were fast and easy to understand. We had it attached to our bike within twenty minutes from the moment we opened the box. To put it to the test, we strapped in our very active toddler, who, surprisingly, didn’t mind being in the trailer when she usually protests strollers at any time. It’s been cold where we live, so we were impressed with the wind and shade protector that kept her warm, even at faster speeds.</p><p>In addition to attaching it to a bicycle, you can turn it into a stroller. Considering the hefty price tag, having two options in one is a significant benefit. Since we don’t ride bikes as often as we would if we were living in Denmark, having the ability to go running with our little one is a big selling point.</p><p>We can see ourselves using this for many years to come as our family grows and we go on adventures. We would recommend this for families who will actually use it for sporting activities and not as an everyday stroller. It’s bulky and heavy, doesn’t fold up super-small, and isn’t as flexible for taking tight corners on city streets.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 31.9 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 34.2 x 31.5 x 14.7 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 100 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: No</li><li>Cleaning: Hand clean</li><li>Child age/weight range: Can sit two at 49 pounds max each</li><li>Dimensions: 45 x 37 x 31.5 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $1,299.95 and $149.95 for the jogging kit</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Compact fold</li><li>Good shock absorption</li><li>Great in warm and cold weather</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Kits and accessories not included</li><li>No hand brake</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A must-have investment for active families looking for a solution to bring the kids along on adventures no matter the terrain or weather.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Thule Chariot Cross Multisport Trailer & Stroller</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jogging Kit</a></p><h3>Best double stroller for all terrain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Thule Urban Glide 3 Double</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best double stroller for all terrain</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Thule Urban Glide 3 Double Jogging Stroller - Black</h3></p><p>This double stroller grows with a family from the birth of their first child through the toddler years of their second. Made with active parents in mind, it offers flexibility and a super-smooth ride on trails, gravel and more. Plus: thoughtful features like a full-coverage canopy with ventilation, air-filled tires and storage space check all the boxes for growing families.</p><p>Our tester, Chelsea, put this Thule best-seller to the test with her two two-year-old son and eight-week-old daughter. When it arrived, she was impressed with the packaging: All cardboard, no styrofoam except for two pieces covering the wheels and some plastic bags.</p><p>“I just needed to open it up, put on the wheels and install the covers,” Chelsea says. “Attaching the shades was the hardest part: you must get the clip onto the track and stagger them in the middle correctly. It took a little arm muscle, but once I figured it out, it was doable. The plus side is once they're on, I don't anticipate having to take them off anytime soon.” It took about 15 minutes to set up in total.</p><p>Claire and her family live in a neighborhood with access to a trail leading to a downtown area, so she could test the Thule on different terrains. At first it was difficult to get down the three stairs from the front door of her house to the street. Once she got comfortable, it was easier to hop a curb. “It was a smooth ride on the sidewalk, and while going downhill, I felt like I had control,” she added.</p><p>Claire particularly liked having a hand brake, even if the hill wasn’t too steep, with a heavier load; it was a safety measure that dulled her anxiety. She also appreciated the ability to lock the front wheel but generally kept it unlocked since she’s newly postpartum and not running. Going over a flagstone path and mud or dirt was bumpy but still smooth. “Overall, I could easily navigate across all different terrains even with the seemingly wide load,” she continued. “While it felt heavy, I still felt like I had control.”</p><p>Another benefit is the vents she could open or close to allow air circulation. Some have a magnetic close, and others have zippers so she can adjust to the weather and her children’s preferences. She also really liked that the foot rest is adjustable: she can see lots of stroller naps in the future between reclining the back and setting up the footrest. In terms of storage, Claire says the basket underneath is sizable and once you remove the covered top, you can load it up. The stroller is already pretty heavy, so she didn't want to add too much weight to all her stuff, but it could handle it.</p><p>Claire says the double stroller folds for stowing but does not have a small profile. If you remove the wheels, it could be smaller but not by much. “I would definitely remove the wheels to put in the trunk, since it’s easy to do so. You push one button to engage and then you can just pull the wheel off,” she says. It can stand up once folded if you lean it against a wall and leave the wheels on but you would need a good storage plan, especially if you don't have a garage or a dedicated space. Overall, she recommends the double stroller for active families — make sure to buy the car seat adapter to use it from the earliest days.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 35.3 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 34.6 × 31.1 × 13.4 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 100 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes, sold separately</li><li>Cleaning: Hand clean</li><li>Child age/weight range: Can sit two at 48.5 pounds max each</li><li>Dimensions: 40.9 × 27.2 × 45.3 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $ 849.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Smooth ride across terrains</li><li>Hand brake</li><li>Easy to navigate</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Takes up a lot of room even when folded</li><li>To use from birth, need additional accessory not included</li><li>Heavy</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An all-terrain design that doesn’t hold you back - designed to tackle any terrain while remaining easy to maneuver and navigate around sidewalks and outdoor adventures alike.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Thule Urban Glide 3 Double</a></p><h3>Best double jogging stroller: <a rel=nofollow href=#>B.O.B Gear Revolution Flex 3.0 Duallie</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best double jogging stroller</span></p><p><h3 class=title>B.O.B Gear Revolution Flex 3.0 Duallie</h3></p><p>The B.O.B Revolution Flex 3.0 Duallie caters to busy parents with its mountain bike-style suspension, ensuring smooth transitions from sidewalks to hiking trails. With its ten storage pockets, there's ample room to accommodate all your essential gear, so whether you're running errands or going on outdoor adventures, this stroller offers durability and convenience.</p><p>My tester, Taylor, signed up to see how B.O.B performed with her 22-month-old, who weighs 28 pounds, and her four-year old, who weighs 35 pounds. The box the stroller arrived in was quite large and heavy but in great shape and very sturdy, and it was clear the company ensured that the stroller would arrive without damage. It took both Taylor and her husband to maneuver it indoors and the cardboard box was thick and held together with large staples (i.e., be aware of these staples if you open them around little ones!).There was a detailed instruction manual, though, in a way, Taylor said it also made the setup instructions seem more complex than they actually were. There were four pieces total. To set up the stroller, all Taylor had to do was push on the two rear wheels and then attach the front wheel using the bolt —and done!</p><p>Taylor has used a double stroller before and knows what she values: easy to push, properly balances the weight between two kids of different sizes, and accommodates a handlebar height for her husband who is 6'3" and herself at 5'6". The B.O.B checked all of her boxes, right from the first jaunt. She put it through the test, and the stroller performed well on a variety of terrains: paved roads and concrete sidewalks, grass, dirt, and gravel paths, as well as even shallow steps/stairs.</p><p>“My first impression of the stroller was that it was quite wide and that it felt like it had a bit of a 'spring' to it,” she says. “In both walking and running on various terrains I felt like I was in good control of the stroller and able to maneuver it around, even on sharp turns easily.”</p><p>She found the handlebar easy to adjust up and down, and offered the widest variety of position options of any stroller she has ever used — easily accommodating people on the short and tall sides. There's also an independent recline for each seat, which is extremely nice, in case one child wants to nap and the other is awake. The seat backs are easy to adjust up or down, and Taylor could sit a child up pretty straight or nearly flat. “The flexibility that provides, especially for two children, is key,” she continues. “The canopies over each seat are also adjustable independently and have nice airflow options/features.”</p><p>Taylor says the stroller is heavy, and with two larger kids it might be hard to push up steep hills. She took the stroller out on steep hills in their neighborhood, and it was a good workout, but not more challenging than any other strollers they’ve used on the same roads.</p><p>While she would recommend the double stroller overall, it has a few drawbacks. First, she says it’s a bit of a pain to adjust the strap heights on the harnesses as you have to dig your fingers into the back of the stroller and pull the straps through small slots, but this isn't something she would be doing often so she wouldn't call it a complaint.</p><p>While there are no handlebar brakes, a wrist loop on the handlebar provides an additional sense of security when going downhill or at faster speeds. Taylor notes the stroller is wide and is a bit tough to fit through a standard door frame if attempting to take it indoors at a cafe, so she would probably have to leave it outdoors if using it in a city while out and about. Another minus was that the storage basket was hard to put bulkier items into.</p><p>“This is not a stroller that would easily fit in the trunk of a sedan or smaller SUV,” she says. “I suppose you could take the wheels off if you needed to fit it more securely for a longer trip, but for everyday use it's not an easy double-stroller to tote about.”</p><p>“Overall it's a sleek and attractive running stroller,” says Taylor. “The handlebar is padded and smooth. The black color hides dirt well, especially from muddy kids' shoes, and the adjustable canopies above each seat work well.”</p><p>“Plus, the stroller looks nice with both kids reclining at different angles.” she adds.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 33.1 pounds</li><li>Folded size: Wheels on: 40 x 30.5 x 17.5 inches; Wheels off: 33 x 30.5 x 12 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 100 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes, sold separately</li><li>Cleaning: Hand clean</li><li>Child age/weight range:100 pounds total; Child age limit minimum: From birth with infant car seat (walk only).; From 8 weeks riding in stroller seat (walk only); From 8 months in stroller seat (Jogging/off-road).</li><li>Dimensions: 48 x 30.5 x 45 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $799.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Adjustable handlebar</li><li>Performs well across terrains</li><li>Independent recline for each seat</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>No hand brake</li><li>Difficult to put bulkier items in storage basket</li><li>Heavy and wide</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The ideal double jogging stroller that will keep your kids comfortable with excellent all-terrain performance for all of your family outings.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>B.O.B Gear Revolution Flex 3.0 Duallie</a></p><h3>Best double stroller for the best weather protection: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Silver Cross Wave Stroller</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best double stroller for the best weather protection</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Silver Cross Wave Stroller</h3></p><p>Prioritizing sustainability, the Silver Cross Wave Double Stroller features fabrics crafted from recycled water bottles. It arrives fully equipped with the main seat and bassinet, ready to use straight out of the box, and a tandem seat is also available for purchase. The One plus One® system allows for the transportation of both a newborn and a toddler, with 30 different configurations, ensuring it grows alongside your family's needs.</p><p>My tester Kate is a nanny, and tested the Silver Cross Wave Single-to-Double Stroller with four different infants between three and seven months, around 15 to 20 pounds and one 2-year-old toddler weighing 33 pounds. When the stroller arrived, it was packaged in two very large boxes: one for the stroller base, bassinet, and seat unit and a second box arrived with a tandem seat. Kate said each accessory was well packaged in plastic wrap, and the rain and bug net covers were packaged in black accessory bags. Overall, she found the stroller very easy to set up! The instructions were straightforward and intuitive, and she was ready to roll in twenty minutes. “All I had to do was unfold the stroller base, attach the large wheels on the front of the stroller and smaller wheels on the back of the stroller. I had to install two accessory pieces in order to attach the tandem seat, but they were clearly marked and very easy to install,” she added.</p><p>She’s used several double strollers before as an infant nanny/daycare provider, so she has a clear view on what she values: various configurations to meet different ages and needs, a great turning radius and a smooth ride. She found overall, the Wave checked her boxes. “I took the stroller out on at least 10 outings in different weather scenarios, and I really appreciated that the umbrella overhead on these strollers extended much further than my prior double stroller, so it was really nice keeping the sun out of the babies’ eyes,” she shared. “I also took the stroller out on a rainy day with two babies, and the rain covers were wonderful! They provided great protection and were easy to cinch onto the stroller seats. The zipper feature on the rain cover was great for accessing the baby to replace their pacifier or soothe them.”</p><p>Kate says the babies really enjoyed the ride! “In the seat closest to me, it was nice having the baby high up facing me. A three-month-old who was previously fussy in my prior double stroller was calmer at this level,” she shares. On one of the outings, Kate took the stroller on a walk to the grocery store (about 1/2 mile away) and the baby was very happy, kicking his feet together happily the whole time. She purchased a couple of bags of groceries and had no problem fitting the grocery bags in the bottom basket of the stroller.</p><p>Overall, The Wave stroller feels light and less bulky than her prior double stroller and goes through corners easily. A downfall is the secondary seat sits lower in the front of the stroller, so it feels like that baby is a little farther away and harder to access. Kate had to keep stopping to check on the baby in the very front of the stroller, furthest from her, as there wasn’t great visibility of that seat while actively pushing the stroller. “When the babies would fall asleep in the stroller, it was really easy to adjust the incline of the seat to lay it flat,” she noted.</p><p>Overall, Kate enjoyed using this stroller. A couple of things she would change would be to add a basket at the stroller handle area to have a place for the caregiver to easily toss keys, phone, and other accessories.</p><p>She would also position the cupholder differently. “It was nice that it could just ‘click’ into place, but on several occasions, it got knocked down when I went through a doorway,” she adds. This stroller also uses a Genuis ™ magnetic buckle, which is a convenient concept, but in reality, it was a bit of a clumsy effort to get all of the five harness points to magnetize together and slowed the process of buckling the child in.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 22.2 pounds</li><li>Folded size: 37 inches x 23 inches x 15 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 187 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes</li><li>Cleaning: Hand clean</li><li>Child age/weight range: Bassinet: Birth to 4-6 months, when baby is starting to push up or roll over; Main Seat: 6 months — 55 Lbs; Tandem seat (sold separately) : 6 Months - 55 Lbs</li><li>Dimensions: 43 x 23 x 37-43 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $1399.99 +</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>High-end look</li><li>Comfortable</li><li>Easy to assemble and use</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Limited visibility of front seat when pushing stroller</li><li>Could use storage area for caregiver accessories</li><li>Magnetic harness is difficult to use when buckling child in</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This sustainable stroller choice including fabric sourced from recycled bottles and recyclable packaging provides a smooth, comfortable ride for your child.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Silver Cross Wave Stroller</a></p><h3>Best double stroller for infant and toddler: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bugaboo Donkey 5 Stroller</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best double stroller for infant and toddler</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bugaboo Donkey 5 Stroller</h3></p><p>Another baby gear brand with a dedicated following is Bugaboo, and its Donkey 5 Mono is designed to adapt seamlessly as your family grows. With just three clicks, it transforms from a single to a double stroller, perfect for expanding families or twins. It's versatile and easy to handle and provides exceptional comfort for babies and parents right from the first outing. The travel system includes two bassinet and two seat frames, a chassis with wheels, two sun canopies, two rain covers, and a side luggage basket for added convenience, which can be used for extra storage until you need the additional bassinet or seat.</p><p>My tester, Raul, used this double stroller with his three-year old daughter and five-month old son. The double stroller arrived in three boxes because of the different additions (bassinet, double seat, etc.) He found it easy to unpack in the convenient packaging. The included instructions provided information on the many potential combinations for using and assembling the stroller (like: double bassinet, double seat, one of each, and so on). It took about 30 minutes to put it together.</p><p>Once built, Raul said it felt high-quality and sturdy to move around. He took the kiddos on a neighborhood walk with flat terrain, hills, gravel, and pavement. Even with the weight (the kids, their snacks and their diaper bag), the stroller was a smooth ride. “The stroller is easy to maneuver with big wheels with good traction and support for different surfaces,” he says.</p><p>While rolling around was easy, Raul says it’s important to note the side-by-side arrangement is both a benefit and a challenge. His toddler likes to look at her baby brother, so being side-by-side is beneficial. It also helps Raul to be able to see both children at the same time, unlike stacking double strollers. That said, it’s like the Cadillac of strollers in terms of width. “Expanded for the full width and two kids, the stroller is wide, making it difficult to navigate on narrow sidewalks,” he says. “While it works fine when going for a walk in a less crowded area or where there is ample amount of space, it wouldn’t make sense for a family living in a city.” It can be used as a single stroller, but it’s still one and a half times the width of a traditional stroller.</p><p>There were some standout features worth mentioning, according to Raul:</p><ul><li>Big sunshades to protect from the elements</li><li>The option to have a 20-pound storage bag next to the toddler seat (instead of the bassinet, when baby brother wasn’t along for the journey)</li><li>An overall sleek and modern design</li></ul><p>The seats feel a bit on the thinner side in terms of cushion and support, and compared to other strollers, there are limited settings for reclining or adjusting the footrest. Raul said it felt pretty bulky when folded up when packing up the Bugaboo. “It doesn't have a locking mechanism, which makes it a bit more difficult to move around or store,” he added. While it’s a high-quality stroller, Raul says it probably wouldn’t make sense for specific types of families, like those with twins or a larger family.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Weight: 27.1 pounds for single, 32.8 pounds in duo mode</li><li>Folded size: 35 x 23.6 x 13.8 inches</li><li>Capacity limit: 50 pounds per seat, underseat basket holds 22 pounds, side luggage basket holds 22 pounds</li><li>Car seat adapter available: Yes, car seat compatibility with dedicated adapters (sold separately)</li><li>Cleaning: Machine washable, and spot clean leather</li><li>Child age/weight range: 0 months to 4 years and to 50 pounds per seat</li><li>Dimensions: 10 x 12 x 33.8 in – 41.7 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $1,399.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>High-quality materials</li><li>Plenty of storage space</li><li>Sturdy</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Wide, difficult to get through doors</li><li>Takes up a lot of space even when folded</li><li>Canopies can catch on one another</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This stroller is packed with storage space and easily converts from single to double use, with roomy side-by-side seating ideal for twins.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bugaboo Donkey 5 Stroller</a></p><h2 id=double-stroller-storage-options>Double stroller storage options</h2><p>Kids come with a lot of stuff.

Check the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning recommendations, as some fabrics may be machine washable while others require spot cleaning with mild detergent and water.</p><p>“Use a soft brush or cloth to scrub away dirt and stains gently, and allow the fabric to air dry thoroughly before reassembling the stroller,” she continues. “Avoid leaving your stroller out in the sunlight as the strong rays can lighten the fabric.” And don’t forget to regularly clean handlebars, wheels, cupholders, and other places to maintain your stroller.</p><h2 id=how-we-test-and-select-the-best-double-stroller>How we test and select the best double stroller</h2><p>We asked parents with two kids or those hoping to grow their families to put the double strollers to the test.

Here’s her advice.</p><h3>Seating options</h3><p>You have two choices with a double stroller: Side-by-side doubles or the more double-decker style configuration where one seat is above and the other is below. If you're expecting or have newborn twins, some double strollers allow for a bassinet attachment, providing a safe, cozy ride. Plus, the babies can see each other, ideal for interaction and entertainment, Billingsley says. And some stroller systems even allow for a rider board to add another child for multiple possibilities.</p><h3>Age range</h3><p>Your decision on seating will be based on the ages and weights of the children who will be riding in the stroller. For instance, if you have a toddler and a newborn, a double stroller that transitions from a single to a double configuration is genius. Of course, depending on age, you might prefer a sit-and-stand double stroller where a bigger kid gets to stand.</p><h3>Ease of use and storage</h3><p>If you have limited space at home or in your vehicle, definitely look at the weight of each model, as well as how they fold, Billingsley recommends.</p><h3>Additional compartments</h3><p>Look for double strollers with additional compartments or pockets for organizing smaller items like snacks, toys, or personal belongings. Parent consoles or organizer bags attached to the handlebars offer convenient storage for essentials like keys, phones, and wallets, keeping them within reach during walks or outings. Billingsley says these compartments help you stay organized and ensure essential items are easily accessible when needed.</p><h3>Wagon-style</h3><p>Wagon-style double strollers are ideal for planning extended outings. While not typically newborn-compatible, Billingsley explains these wagons provide ample space for bulky items, groceries, or picnic essentials, making them ideal for family adventures or trips to the park. The generous storage area ensures you can comfortably transport everything you need for a day out with your little ones, enhancing convenience and enjoyment for the entire family.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How can a family know if a double stroller will work for their lifestyle?</h3><p>To put it simply, Billingsley if you have two kids that are very close in age or twins, there really is no other viable option than a double stroller for most families. That said, if you rely heavily on public transportation or have limited space in your vehicle, a double stroller may pose challenges in terms of portability and storage. “In such cases, you may opt for alternative solutions like baby carriers or single strollers with attachment boards for older siblings,” she adds.</p><h3>What age is a double stroller for?</h3><p>Age is one of the most important factors when determining <a rel=alternate href=#>how to choose a stroller</a>. Typically, you’ll get the most use out of your double stroller between six months to five years old, although this can vary depending on the child's development and the stroller's specific features, Billingsley says.</p><h4>Two-year-olds</h4><p>A double stroller can be a practical choice for parents with active two-year-olds who may have limited endurance or need containment in crowded or unfamiliar environments. For a two-year old, consider strollers with secure harness systems and adjustable recline positions, as well as ample storage space for snacks, drinks, and toys to keep your toddler entertained and satisfied during runs or walks.</p><h4>Three-year-olds</h4><p>At age three, children are typically more independent and may have increased stamina for walking or running alongside their parents. However, a double stroller can still be beneficial for longer outings or when exploring unfamiliar terrain. You may encourage your three-year-old to walk or run alongside the stroller for short distances, gradually increasing their autonomy and confidence while still providing the option for them to rest or ride when needed.</p><h4>Four-year-olds</h4><p>By age four, many children have developed sufficient physical skills and endurance to keep up with their parents during outdoor activities. While a double stroller may not be a necessity at this stage, it can still be useful for family outings that involve long distances or challenging terrain. Rider boards come handy at this age and are fun. You could also encourage your child to walk or run alongside the stroller, using it as a backup option.</p><p>“For children with developmental delays or sensory processing issues, a jogging stroller can provide a safe and secure outdoor stimulation and exploration environment,” Billingsley says. “Additionally, the rhythmic movement of the stroller and exposure to natural stimuli can help regulate sensory input and promote relaxation.”</p><h3>Can you take a double stroller through airport security?</h3><p>Yes, Billingsley says you can take a double stroller through airport security, but there are some procedures to follow. “Typically, you'll need to remove your child from the stroller before it goes through the security screening process,” she says. “However, TSA agents are trained to assist with strollers and can manually inspect them.”</p><p>While the stroller may not fit through the scanner the way a smaller <a rel=alternate href=#>travel stroller</a> possibly could, TSA agents will wheel it through and perform necessary screenings using alternative methods, such as a wand or physical inspection. It's important to be prepared to disassemble or fold the stroller if needed and to cooperate with TSA agents to ensure a smooth security process. Additionally, having a kickboard attachment for a single stroller can be helpful in case of any issues with the double stroller, she adds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llKTCo7jEZqqtqp%2Bhuaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quartiers-prioritaires-un-trimestre-supplementaire-pour-finaliser-les-contrats-de-ville.html><span>←</span><span>un trimestre supplmentaire pour finaliser les contrats de ville</span></a>
