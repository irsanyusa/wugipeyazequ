During the new episode, judge Howie Mandel hit the Golden Buzzer for a surprising dance act.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-hits-golden-buzzer-on-agt-season-19>Howie Mandel Hits Golden Buzzer on AGT Season 19</h2><p>The final act from Tuesday’s episode appeared to be a solo dancer from Sydney, Australia, named Zach. The 17-year-old said he was going to call his mom if the audition went well. As the performance began, the stage lights were dimmed.</p><p>It soon became apparent that Zach wasn’t a solo dancer. Rather, he was part of a dance group called Brent Street. They started the performance by sticking their hands through a large piece of fabric. After that, they showed off an energetic contemporary dance routine set to “Hope” by NF.</p><p>All four judges gave the group a standing ovation. Sofia Vergara said their audition was “for sure the coolest thing I’ve seen today.” Simon Cowell said he could see how much it meant to the group to perform on the AGT stage.</p><p>Howie Mandel responded to the surprising act with a surprise of his own. He crouched down behind the judges’ table and popped up to hit the Golden Buzzer, sending Brent Street straight to the Season 19 live shows.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET ‘AGT’ GOLDEN BUZZER DANCE CREW BRENT STREET</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-other-acts-impressed-the-judges>What Other Acts Impressed the Judges?</h2><p>Tuesday’s show only featured one Golden Buzzer act, but that doesn’t meant there weren’t other auditions that impressed the judges. That includes singer Stephanie Rainey, who performed a song called “Please Don’t Go” about the death of her young nephew. Cowell said it was the best original song he’s heard this season.</p><p>The judges were also impressed by Hypers Kids Africa, a group from Uganda who combined dance and acrobatics for a high-energy routine that had everyone smiling. They also enjoyed father-son rap duo Flewnt and Inkabee from Australia, who performed a fast-paced original song.</p><p>Other acts had the judges more divided, such as DaksDominoes — twin brothers who took all night to set up a domino act. Heidi Klum didn’t think it was a million-dollar act. However, the other three judges decided to give the brothers another chance and send them through.</p><p>Klum also wasn’t impressed by Daniel Simu, who danced with a robot he designed. She even hit the red buzzer during the performance. The other three judges chose to vote “yes” to sending Daniel through.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s AGT Season 19 auditions?
