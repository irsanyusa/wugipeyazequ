She first gained recognition in her home country in 2022 when she placed in the Top 5 of the third season of Indonesia’s Got Talent. Her standout performance in the finals even included a guest appearance by famous AGT alum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sacred Riana</a>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fritzy-rosmerian-has-never-been-on-the-agt-stage>Fritzy Rosmerian Has Never Been on The AGT Stage</h2><p>Due to her success on Indonesia’s Got Talent, Fritzy was nominated and selected as one of the Top 40 acts for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Fantasy League</a>, earning her a spot in the Draft Pool. This speaks to her immense talent and potential on the global stage.</p><p>The 15-year-old was born on July 28, 2008 in Jakarta. From a very young age, Fritzy was modeling and walking fashion shows. She appeared regularly in Anakku magazine as a toddler model. Over time, her interest in magic blossomed and she started honing her skills by performing at events around Indonesia.</p><p>In 2019, Fritzy’s talent was acknowledged nationally when she won the award for Best Talent for Indonesian Little Girls. This only further motivated her to pursue her dreams of being an entertainer. Her big break came in 2022 when she auditioned for Indonesia’s Got Talent. Her stage presence and illusions instantly impressed the judges and audience.</p><p>Fritzy made it all the way to the semi-finals where she continued to amaze with innovative magic acts. Despite tough competition, she finished Top 5, proving her star power. Beyond magic, Fritzy is also an accomplished dancer which adds artistry to her performances.</p><p>The Indonesia’s Got Talent exposure led to Fritzy currently gaining over 180,000 Instagram followers at the time of writing. She actively engages with fans online while sharing updates about her career. At only 15, her future in entertainment is limitless thanks to her sheer talent, charisma, dedication, and versatility.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fritzy-rosmerian-collaborated-with-the-sacred-riana>Fritzy Rosmerian Collaborated With The Sacred Riana</h2><p>In a surprise collaboration on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indonesia’s Got Talent</a>, rising star magician Fritzy teamed up with Asia’s Got Talent&nbsp;Season 2 winner The Sacred Riana. During the grand finals on October 3, 2022, Fritzy initially performed solo with his signature magic involving polaroid photos of the audience.</p><p>However, the act took an unexpected turn when The Sacred Riana emerged from behind a banner on stage, frightening the judges. Her sinister persona startled the likes of Rossa and Denny Sumargo as she crept towards the judges’ table. The inclusion of Riana, known for her dark, horror-themed magic, added a thrilling twist to Fritzy’s performance.</p><p>At just 15 years old, sharing the stage with a former Asia’s Got Talent champion was a huge honor for Fritzy. He expressed that Riana was an inspirational figure to him. Collaborating with such an established magician proved Fritzy could hold his own among Indonesia’s top entertainers.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Masked-Singer-Calfiornia-Roll-Pentatonix-220x160.jpg alt="Looking Back At Pentatonix’s Unforgettable Journey From Acapella Show to Global Stardom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYq6owIyfmKeskajGbrjEmp6unaNifnZ52J6Yq2WfobFuucCgoJyhkaN6p77IrbGyZaKkwK6x0aKYp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cotation-des-demandes-de-logement-social-le-decret-est-paru.html><span>←</span><span>Cotation des demandes de logement social : le dcret est paru</span></a>
