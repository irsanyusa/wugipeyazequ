Farrow had just ended her <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;musician André Previn, with whom she had adopted a&nbsp;little girl from <a href=# title="South Korea" data-link=tag>South Korea</a>&nbsp;— her name was Soon-Yi. During the twelve years that the actress and the director shared, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enlarged</a> the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> by&nbsp;adopting two more children. Then, in&nbsp;1987, Satchel Ronan, the only biological child of&nbsp;their union, was born.</p><p>As&nbsp;their professional relationship grew stronger thanks to&nbsp;the thirteen films they shot together, their emotional bond slowly cooled. No&nbsp;one imagined the media fight that was brewing between the two.</p><p>In&nbsp;the early 1990s, Woody and Soon-Yi’s relationship took a&nbsp;different turn. At&nbsp;first, their plans were innocent, such as&nbsp;going to&nbsp;games or&nbsp;visiting cinemas and museums, with Mia’s knowledge and consent, but they soon moved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;more intimate level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/065/dc5/21f6f7563a804705931ffea667.jpg><p>In&nbsp;early 1992, the scandal exploded right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;Mia’s eyes. One day, the actress found photos of&nbsp;her daughter in&nbsp;the filmmaker’s apartment. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;package of&nbsp;intimate photos of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, of&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl. I&nbsp;took them and realized they were all of&nbsp;Soon-Yi. They were of&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter.”</p><p>However, she chose to&nbsp;remain silent and spent part of&nbsp;her year planning the legal struggle she would wage against her partner. In&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;that same year, Farrow <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accused</a> Allen of&nbsp;attempting to&nbsp;inappropriately touch Dylan, her other adopted daughter, and put the girl’s testimony into evidence. In&nbsp;response, the filmmaker <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sued</a> her and asked for custody of&nbsp;all the children they shared, while making public his relationship with Soon-Yi, who had already left home and was living with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d0a/4f2/c12aee559994360a3dc2c9c6ee.jpg><p>RPM / SIPA / EAST NEWS</p><p>By&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the following year, several experts dismissed the girl’s testimony as&nbsp;“inconsistent,” as&nbsp;she had given a&nbsp;different version on&nbsp;each <a href=# title=cross-examination data-link=tag>cross-examination</a>. On&nbsp;June&nbsp;8, 1993, a&nbsp;judge attempted to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bring order</a> to&nbsp;the side-by-side attacks with his ruling&nbsp;— he&nbsp;awarded custody of&nbsp;the children to&nbsp;Mia, dismissed charges of&nbsp;improper access to&nbsp;Dylan for lack of&nbsp;evidence, and limited Allen’s visitation with the little ones. The only thing that seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;going well in&nbsp;his personal life was his relationship with Soon-Yi, whom he&nbsp;married four years later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/353/54d/eb6dc35eb7850e5ab1136ec310.jpg><p>SAMA / SIPA / East News</p><p>The couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> their union <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>official</a> on&nbsp;December&nbsp;22, 1997, in&nbsp;Venice and with their marriage, a&nbsp;new stage began for the filmmaker. By&nbsp;then, he&nbsp;was 61&nbsp;years old and she was 26. Since then, the young woman has dedicated herself to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;full-time wife and housewife.</p><p>As&nbsp;the years passed in&nbsp;their relationship, they decided to&nbsp;become parents, so&nbsp;they chose to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopt</a> two girls, Bechet Dumaine Allen and Manzie Tio Allen, who are now adults but have stayed away from the spotlight and the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6b/71c/599b115c49b328997dafbdc129.jpg><p>Union Press / Sipa / East News</p><p>Over the years, Allen has been dedicated to&nbsp;defending and validating his relationship with his wife. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, the filmmaker <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “I&nbsp;started the relationship and thought it&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;serious, just be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fling. But it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;life of&nbsp;its own. We&nbsp;began going together, then living together and were enjoying&nbsp;it. I’m 35&nbsp;years older and somehow the dynamic worked.<br>I&nbsp;was paternal. She responded to&nbsp;someone paternal. I&nbsp;liked her youth and her energy. She deferred to&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I was happy to&nbsp;give her an&nbsp;enormous amount of&nbsp;decision-making and let her take charge of&nbsp;so&nbsp;many things. She flourished.”</p><p>For the director, however, being paternal and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considering himself</a> her father were very different things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/261/efe/8aa97a5ae389035cdfc1b38b90.jpg><p>MARCOCCHI GIULIO / SIPA / EAST NEWS</p><p>Therefore, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very common to&nbsp;hear people say that “Woody Allen married his daughter,” but, according to&nbsp;Soon-Yi herself, she never saw Woody as&nbsp;a&nbsp;father since he&nbsp;did not live in&nbsp;the house with them.</p><p>She once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “We&nbsp;didn’t see him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;father. He&nbsp;didn’t leave clothes in&nbsp;our house, not even a&nbsp;toothbrush.” And everything seems to&nbsp;indicate that their choices were the right ones because, more than 30&nbsp;years later, they continue to&nbsp;show themselves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong, stable, and lasting couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95d/13a/1dbfa852d6860f36eafb569184.jpg><p>Preview photo credit ELIGIO PAONI / Contrasto / East News<span>, </span>MARCOCCHI GIULIO / SIPA / EAST NEWS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSwu8OyZJqknJq7brnAq6minZRitaq%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzedOhnGatnpi8r8LEp6uip56WuW6%2F06ipsmWfm3q1tMRmnaKknaKurLHRZpinnF2ptaZ51qikmqZdrLWweceaqmaalZq7brTIrGSwoZaaeqe70WakqKqVYoVyf5Nub2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./women-rule-rwanda-parliament-after-latest-elections.html><span>←</span><span>Women rule Rwanda parliament after latest elections</span></a>
