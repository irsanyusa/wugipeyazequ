In&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary house outlet that we&nbsp;use to&nbsp;charge the phone, the voltage is&nbsp;110&nbsp;volts. A&nbsp;high-voltage power line that provides electricity to&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;buildings has a&nbsp;voltage of&nbsp;100,000&nbsp;volts. The energy of&nbsp;one lightning strike is&nbsp;more than 10&nbsp;million volts!</p><p>And the temperature of&nbsp;lightning is&nbsp;almost twice the temperature on&nbsp;the Sun’s surface. And this incredible charge is&nbsp;flying at&nbsp;a&nbsp;speed just two and a&nbsp;half times slower than the speed of&nbsp;light! Now imagine what happens to&nbsp;a&nbsp;person when lightning strikes them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/51f/9f0/11e7f45ab3b498debef7373adb.png><p>Well let me&nbsp;tell you. The discharge passes through the body in&nbsp;one-hundredth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;second. Lightning can stop our hearts and disrupt the work of&nbsp;the entire nervous system. You may not even realize what has happened at&nbsp;first. Perhaps you will lose consciousness, and your body will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;shock. Every day, there are several million lightning strikes in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>Fortunately, you have little chance of&nbsp;getting hit by&nbsp;one. The odds that lightning will strike you is&nbsp;about 15,300 to&nbsp;1. About&nbsp;20,000 people are struck by&nbsp;lightning every year. The chances that lightning will strike you twice are even smaller. And what are the odds that you will be&nbsp;struck by&nbsp;lightning 7&nbsp;times throughout your life? It&nbsp;seems impossible, but one person experienced it&nbsp;for himself.</p><p>His name was Roy Sullivan. He&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;1912 in&nbsp;Greene County, Virginia, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big family with 7&nbsp;children. Roy was an&nbsp;ordinary guy and was no&nbsp;different from his brothers and sisters. But for some reason, the natural element chose him. In&nbsp;1936, he&nbsp;began working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;ranger at&nbsp;Shenandoah National Park. There, lightning struck him seven times over 35&nbsp;years.</p><p>So, the first accident happened in&nbsp;April 1942. On&nbsp;that day, a&nbsp;strong thunderstorm began. Roy took refuge in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new fire tower, where the builders hadn’t installed a&nbsp;lightning rod. Lightning struck the building several times. A&nbsp;massive fire started inside, and Roy ran out. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;few feet away from the shelter, lightning hit his toe and burned a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;his shoe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1b0/ec8/17e7755252b0e284e2229ad312.png><p>The next time occurred 27&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;July 1969. Roy was working in&nbsp;the national park. He&nbsp;was driving a&nbsp;truck through hilly terrain when a&nbsp;storm started. Lightning struck him through the open car window. The charge burned his eyebrows and eyelashes and slightly touched his hair. Roy lost consciousness, and the car continued to&nbsp;move. It&nbsp;stopped at&nbsp;the very edge of&nbsp;the cliff. Fifteen minutes later, Roy came to&nbsp;his senses.</p><p>A&nbsp;year later, in&nbsp;July 1970, the third time occurred. The weather was fine. But in&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;minutes, clouds became thicker, and a&nbsp;thunderstorm began. Lightning struck a&nbsp;transformer near Roy. The man ran away as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible, but nature got him again. Lightning hit his shoulder.</p><p>Two years later, in&nbsp;1972, lightning struck Roy for the fourth time while he&nbsp;was working at&nbsp;a&nbsp;national park station. The charge set his hair on&nbsp;fire, and the man ran to&nbsp;the bathroom and used a&nbsp;wet towel to&nbsp;put out the flames on&nbsp;his burning head. From that moment, Roy began to&nbsp;suspect that some invisible evil force had been pursuing him. He&nbsp;started to&nbsp;carry a&nbsp;bottle of&nbsp;water with him to&nbsp;put out the fire in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;another hit.</p><p>The 5th strike happened in&nbsp;the national park again. It&nbsp;occurred in&nbsp;1973. Roy tripped over a&nbsp;rock and fell. At&nbsp;that moment, he&nbsp;noticed thunderclouds in&nbsp;the sky. Frightened, he&nbsp;ran to&nbsp;his truck, got inside, and stepped on&nbsp;the gas. Roy drove as&nbsp;far away from that spot as&nbsp;possible. Then he&nbsp;stopped and got out of&nbsp;the car to&nbsp;see where the storm was. And at&nbsp;that moment, lightning struck again. It&nbsp;went through his left arm and left leg and set his shoe on&nbsp;fire. Roy quickly climbed back into the truck and extinguished the fire using his water bottle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/52b/108/f7faa05222ad0e108470bf78a0.png><p>In&nbsp;1976 the sixth case occurred. Roy was walking along a&nbsp;trail in&nbsp;the park just one mile away from the place where lightning struck him the last time. And then storm clouds appeared again. Lightning flashed and stung Roy in&nbsp;the palm. After the 6th strike, he&nbsp;began to&nbsp;suspect something was wrong with the park. After forty years of&nbsp;working, Roy finally decided to&nbsp;quit. Finally.</p><p>He&nbsp;hoped the lightning would stop chasing him, but he&nbsp;was wrong. By&nbsp;that time, the man had already become a&nbsp;celebrity. But such fame didn’t let him enjoy life. People were afraid to&nbsp;be&nbsp;near him because they believed that lightning could hit them at&nbsp;any moment. Journalists gave Roy Sullivan the nicknames “Spark Ranger” and “Human Lightning Conductor.” Of&nbsp;course, the man disliked all this and felt very lonely.</p><p>But besides this problem, he&nbsp;also suffered from constant fears and the feeling of&nbsp;persecution. All the time, he&nbsp;was waiting for the lightning to&nbsp;strike again at&nbsp;any moment. Fortunately, he&nbsp;was married. His wife supported him and helped him in&nbsp;everything. After quitting his job, Roy decided to&nbsp;move with his wife to&nbsp;the small town of&nbsp;Dooms, Virginia. Wow, Dooms. Talk about foreshadowing...</p><p>It&nbsp;was only a&nbsp;year without accidents. Then, on&nbsp;June&nbsp;25, 1977, lightning struck Roy again. He&nbsp;went fishing at&nbsp;the local pond early in&nbsp;the morning. The catch was good, but the sky was overcast. Roy immediately felt that there would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;strike. There was a&nbsp;smell of&nbsp;sulfur in&nbsp;the air, and the hairs on&nbsp;his arms stood on&nbsp;end. His whole body tensed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/479/f67/ec6fb75906bdf0db3139d90c1d.png><p>Lightning struck Roy in&nbsp;the head, passing through his chest and stomach. The man ran to&nbsp;his car to&nbsp;take cover. At&nbsp;that moment, a&nbsp;hungry bear came out of&nbsp;the forest. He&nbsp;approached Roy’s bucket of&nbsp;fish to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;all the trout the man had caught. Roy ran out of&nbsp;the vehicle with the hair on&nbsp;his head smoldering to&nbsp;chase the animal away. After the 7th lightning strike, he&nbsp;lost hearing in&nbsp;his left ear and realized that he&nbsp;couldn’t hide from the lightning anywhere.</p><p>His wife was afraid to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with him outside during a&nbsp;thunderstorm. One day, she was hanging laundry in&nbsp;the backyard. Roy came out of&nbsp;the house to&nbsp;help her. A&nbsp;few minutes later, lightning struck his wife. Fortunately, she wasn’t badly injured. After that, besides fear and social loneliness, he&nbsp;felt guilt. Of&nbsp;course, many doctors and scientists tried to&nbsp;help Roy, but no&nbsp;one managed to&nbsp;find the reason for this strange phenomenon.</p><p>According to&nbsp;science, each time, it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;coincidence. Mathematics and physics were powerless here. With such answers from scientists, Roy believed that invisible forces were pursuing him or&nbsp;that fate punished him for something. Perhaps the answer lies in&nbsp;the man’s past. The National Park Service and doctors documented all 7&nbsp;times when he&nbsp;was struck by&nbsp;lightning.</p><p>But there was another, 8th time, which couldn’t be&nbsp;confirmed. According to&nbsp;Roy, lightning struck him in&nbsp;his youth when he&nbsp;was helping his father mow wheat. The discharge hit the scythe blade. No&nbsp;one but the boy saw&nbsp;it. Perhaps at&nbsp;that moment, the lightning changed something in&nbsp;his body and made him more attractive for the next hits. Lightning always chooses the path of&nbsp;least resistance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d51/284/5ee1ae5a03aa677f5b76ee6c4f.png><p>And this is&nbsp;how lightning occurs. Rain, ice, and snow particles collide with one another inside a&nbsp;storm. This process increases the imbalance between clouds and the ground, negatively charging the lower layers of&nbsp;clouds. Things down there, like trees and the earth, get positively charged and create another imbalance. Nature tries to&nbsp;remedy this imbalance between two opposite charges by&nbsp;passing an&nbsp;electric current through them.</p><p>Perhaps, nature felt some charge imbalance in&nbsp;Roy’s body and tried to&nbsp;remedy&nbsp;it. But why did he&nbsp;get struck at&nbsp;an&nbsp;interval of&nbsp;one or&nbsp;two years? Besides, more than 20&nbsp;years passed between the first and second hit.</p><p>Scientists still can’t explain what happened to&nbsp;him. Maybe Roy was just an&nbsp;attractive guy. As&nbsp;you can probably predict, Roy Sullivan was listed in&nbsp;the Guinness Book of&nbsp;Records as&nbsp;the person struck by&nbsp;lightning most often in&nbsp;the world.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucCnZLCgn2K0sMCMrKurrZOgeqPFjKWgoKCko7avs4xwZK2hnZrAbq3NnWSsraKrtrexw2ZvamxkaYFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./she-doesnt-wash-her-face-in-the-morning-and-other-beauty-secrets-salma-hayek-relies-on-811784.html><span>←</span><span>This Is Why I Have No Botox Salma Hayek Reveals She Uses a Special Mexican Ingredient That Reg</span></a>
